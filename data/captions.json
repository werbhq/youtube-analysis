        "you have to learn one of the other.",
        "we're going to learn python three just because it's I think probably the best for a beginner to learn.",

        "the next step",
        "is we need to choose a text",
        "editor so",
        "we're going to be writing a bunch of code so we're going to need some you know environment of some program that we can write all that code in.",

        "and really just sort of give you an introduction so",
        "over here",
        "we have our",
        "basic text editor and so",
        "any of the",
        "python code that I write inside of this file",

        "this python file",
        "has a bunch of",
        "python code inside of it.",
        "and basically what we're doing when we're",

        "the more complex the instructions we give to the computer the more complex",

        "the computer can",
        "carry up.",

        "in order to draw out a shape onto the screen so",
        "I'm actually going to draw out",
        "a little triangle.",
        "so over here,",
        "we can actually print something out onto the",
        "screen and python using something called a print statement so I can just type out",

        "I can just type",
        "some quotation marks",
        "and inside the quotation marks",
        "we can",
        "put whatever we want to print out onto the screen.",
        "so I'm gonna",
        "copy this and I'm actually going to make",
        "a few of these little prince statements",
        "and we're going actually draw a sheep.",
        "so",
        "we're gonna draw like",
        "a triangle type shape",
        "so down here it's gonna draw a forward slash",
        "and then up here I'll make a space and we'll do another foreign sash",
        "here will make",
        "two spaces",
        "with united forward slash.",
        "and over here",
        "we can make three spaces and afford sash.",
        "and now I'm going to draw like a vertical bar is going all the way down.",
        "and actually we can do some underscores here as well.",
        "I think high school",
        "right so now we have our triangle looking shave and you can see",
        "it looks kind of like a right triangle",
        "so I can save my file.",
        "and I can either come up here to run and",
        "click run app",
        "or of using pie charm you can also just come over here and click this play button",
        "and when I click the play button I want you to notice what happens down here",
        "so",
        "down here we have this little window and",
        "this is called the consul",
        "and it basically the council is a place where python is going to",
        "output some information so",
        "when we use this print statement were basically telling python late",
        "hey can you print something out onto the consul.",
        "so",
        "there's a lot of situations where we're gonna wanna see what's going on in our code.",
        "and we can use that print statement and",
        "print things out to the council.",
        "and we can basically like have a little window into what our programs doing",
        "in our case we're just going to be printing out this triangle onto the consul.",
        "so I'm gonna come over here and click this play button",
        "and you'll see down here",
        "we're actually printing out that",
        "triangle",
        "so mission accomplished we were able to print out our shape.",
        "so I can really draw any shape I want it as long as I was",
        "able to",
        "specify",
        "inside of these print statements.",
        "so",
        "essentially what python's doing when I click that play button",
        "is it's going into this file and it's looking at all of these instructions in order.",
        "so the first thing it does is it goes to this instruction and it says",
        "ok,",
        "they want me to draw out these like little forward slash in this vertical bar onto the strain,",
        "once it does that it goes down to this instruction it says",
        "ok",
        "they want me to print something on again",
        "when it prints dot out it goes down to this instruction",
        "etc",
        "so",
        "python is actually going to execute the lines of code that we write",
        "in order.",
        "so",
        "the order in which I write the instructions",
        "matters a lot.",
        "so for example if I was to take this last line here",
        "and put it up here at the top.",
        "now when I save the file.",
        "instead of just drawing up that triangle.",
        "it's going to draw out",
        "this little upside down",
        "bottom thing at the top and then",
        "the rest of the triangle down here so",
        "the order of the instructions actually matters a lot.",
        "so this is basically how your python programs are going to go.",
        "as we go through this course we're going to learn more and more of these little lines so here we're just using this little print function basically and just print something out on to the screen,",
        "there's a bunch of little things like this that we can learn as we go through",
        "will learn more and more instructions that we can give to the computer.",
        "but in this lesson I just wanted to kind of show you guys the basics right.",
        "oh",
        "we can essentially just define these little instructions for the computer",
        "and the computer will execute them",
        "in order.",
        "and this tutorial I wanna talk to you guys about using variables in",
        "python.",
        "now in python and you're going to be dealing with",
        "a lot of data",
        "and so a lot of times in our program we're going to be working with",
        "all types of information and data and values,",
        "and sometimes that data",
        "can be difficult to manage.",
        "so in python we have this thing called a variable.",
        "and it's basically just a container",
        "where we can store certain",
        "data values.",
        "and when we use a variable when we put those",
        "data values inside containers.",
        "it makes it a lot",
        "easier for us to work with and manage",
        "all of the different",
        "data inside of our programs.",
        "so variables are extremely helpful and it's sort of like a",
        "core topic in",
        "python that you're really going to want to know and master.",
        "so in this tutorial omelets each you guys.",
        "everything you need to know to get started with variables we're going to look at what they are",
        "why they're useful and we'll look at the different types of variables",
        "and the different types of",
        "data that we can store",
        "inside of variables,",
        "who over here in my",
        "python file I just have a very simple program.",
        "and it's basically just printing some text out onto the screen.",
        "and so this is actually a little story that I wrote it says.",
        "there once was a man named george",
        "he was seventy years old.",
        "he really liked the name george",
        "but didn't like being seventy.",
        "so this is a valid python program I can go ahead and",
        "run this program",
        "and you'll see down here in the council",
        "everything prints out and",
        "it looks great so",
        "we have an awesome little python program here.",
        "well let's say that inside of our story I wanted to change",
        "the character's name",
        "so instead of naming the character george let's say I wanted to name the character",
        "jon",
        "well",
        "I'm going to have to go through and I'm going to have to manually change the name george to the name john at every place inside of this story where it's mentioned.",
        "so I'm not to go over here and I'll say",
        "ok",
        "john I'm going to have to manually change that",
        "and then",
        "ok it's out here we're going up to again manually type in john and change it to john.",
        "so in order to change the character's name I had to manually go in and change it in both places.",
        "and now let's say",
        "ok",
        "maybe we want to change the characters ne",
        "age also so in addition to changing the name.",
        "we also want to change the age let's make him a little bit younger so why don't we say john is going to be thirty five.",
        "so you see here I had to come here and manually change the age and then come down here",
        "and manually change it again",
        "right.",
        "and now that we changed it like",
        "it's going to work it's going to be updated in our program.",
        "but you'll notice that in order to make that change like I had to look through the entire program find it where that",
        "value was and change it,",
        "and",
        "this was only with",
        "four lines",
        "of the story imagine if I had a story that was like",
        "thousands of lines long.",
        "and we mentioned that the character's name and",
        "age like",
        "hundreds of times.",
        "we don't have to look through each one of those lines and",
        "manually change the character's name",
        "and that is not a very good way for us to do this",
        "and",
        "it's really not a good way for us to manage the data in our program right the",
        "character's name in the age.",
        "and so we can actually use a variable",
        "in order to store",
        "the character's name and the characters.",
        "age.",
        "and when we use that variable it'll make it a lot",
        "easier for us to put the character's name and age.",
        "inside of our little program here.",
        "so I'm gonna show you guys how we can create a variable for the character's name and age.",
        "now it's going to go up here above this print statement.",
        "and",
        "up here I want to create a variable.",
        "so when we create a variable in",
        "python we actually need to give",
        "python",
        "a couple pieces of information.",
        "the first piece of information we need to give python is the name of the variable so I need to actually assign a name",
        "to this container where we're going to be storing information.",
        "so all I have to do is just type out",
        "the name of the variable",
        "that I want to create so I'm going to create a",
        "variable called character name.",
        "so I'm just going to say",
        "character",
        "adam's they underscore",
        "name",
        "so generally when you're creating a name",
        "for a variable in python.",
        "you want to separate different words",
        "with an underscore so I have two words here and I'm separating them with an underscore.",
        "and now what I need to do is I need to",
        "put a value",
        "inside of this very more so",
        "basically what I can do is I can just say",
        "equals",
        "and over here I can type a value",
        "so I'm just gonna type out the character's name inside of",
        "quotation marks.",
        "so we're just gonna type out john.",
        "so now we have a variable for the character's name",
        "and below this character named variable I want to create another variable called",
        "character",
        "age certain just going to tape out",
        "character",
        "underscore",
        "age.",
        "and I'm going to set this",
        "equal to the characters age which is thirty five.",
        "so we now have two variables,",
        "one representing the character's name and one representing the characters",
        "age.",
        "so what I can do now as I can replace",
        "the character's name inside of this story",
        "with",
        "this variable.",
        "and I'm gonna show you guys how to do that",
        "so if we want to put a variable inside of this print statement.",
        "I'm actually going to have to do a couple of things.",
        "the first thing I'm going to have to do is",
        "end off this",
        "text in here so I'm going to have to put",
        "a",
        "quotation marks here the end",
        "and you can see I'm basically",
        "wrapping this whole thing into a",
        "single like quoted line.",
        "and now I also have this tax overhear the end so I'm going to have to put a quotation mark here.",
        "so now I have",
        "a",
        "bunch of tax year in quotation marks.",
        "and then I also have tax over here in quotation marks",
        "now inside of here",
        "instead of",
        "saying the character's name",
        "I want to refer to that character name",
        "variable",
        "so I'm just going to say plus",
        "character",
        "underscore name",
        "and I want to say another plus sign so I basically I'm saying I want to",
        "print out all of this text,",
        "plus",
        "the value that stored inside of character name",
        "plus",
        "all of this text.",
        "and what this will do is they will actually print out the character's name we print this",
        "so I'm gonna go ahead and run this program",
        "and you'll see down here",
        "and actually let me put a space over here,",
        "and we'll run it again.",
        "so you can see down here,",
        "we still are printing out there once was a man named",
        "john.",
        "and so what python is doing is when it executes this line of code",
        "it's coming over here and it's seeing",
        "ok they want to turn out.",
        "the value inside of character name",
        "so it",
        "python's going to go up here it's going to get the value,",
        "and it's going to",
        "insert it inside of there",
        "so I can basically do this for every instance of the character name in my file so I can",
        "you know",
        "r is copy this guy right here",
        "and",
        "I can just paste it down here where the characters name is",
        "so apace this",
        "and you can see now were doing exactly the same thing that we did up there.",
        "I can also do this for the characters",
        "age someone to come down here",
        "and I'll paste in what we just paste it in.",
        "and I'm going to change this instead of character name was changed to character",
        "age.",
        "and I'm going to do this",
        "in one more spots are going to do this over here we're mentioning the age",
        "and again I'll just change this to",
        "carry",
        "your age.",
        "and so now when I run this program it's going to print out the same story they were printing out before,",
        "but",
        "now I don't actually have to type in the character's name and the characters age.",
        "I can just refer to this",
        "variable.",
        "and the cool thing about variables as if I wanted to change the character's name.",
        "now all I have to do is change it up here so I could change the characters names you like",
        "tom or something.",
        "and we could also change their age so I could change",
        "the age to be like fifty",
        "and now that's going to automatically update throughout our entire story",
        "when I click this play button you'll see",
        "now we're using the name tom",
        "and he's fifty years old.",
        "so that's where variables can come in handy and",
        "this can be a really awesome way to control and manage",
        "the data that's inside of our programs",
        "with variables you can also",
        "modify their values",
        "so",
        "for example let's say that halfway through the story I wanted to change the character's name",
        "why can just make some new lines over here,",
        "and down here",
        "I can actually assign a new",
        "value to one of these variables.",
        "so I can say like",
        "character",
        "underscore name,",
        "and in order to give it a different value all I have to do is just say equals",
        "and will give it a different value and so",
        "let's say halfway through the story we want to change the character's name to mike",
        "one now when I run my program",
        "you'll see here in the first part of the story it says",
        "there once was a man named",
        "tom.",
        "and in the second part of the story,",
        "it's referring to the name as",
        "mike.",
        "so I actually",
        "updated the variable",
        "inside of my program",
        "over here",
        "and that's a really awesome way",
        "you know a lot of times in these programs you're going to want to be modifying the values of variables",
        "so you can do it",
        "just like that.",
        "and so finally I want to talk to you guys about the different",
        "types of data that we can store inside of these variables.",
        "so over here",
        "I have the character name and character age",
        "and",
        "I'm actually storing what are called strings,",
        "so a string is basically just",
        "plain tax straight",
        "so the name tom that's just plain text",
        "down here these guys are strings as well.",
        "so there's a data type in python,",
        "called a string and it's just",
        "basically going to store",
        "plain text",
        "so",
        "you know any text that you would have like in a story early know someone's name",
        "you can store inside of a string.",
        "there's also another type of data",
        "that we can store inside of python",
        "which is numbers",
        "so an additional storing text we can also store",
        "numbers.",
        "so if I wanted to start a number for example",
        "let's say we wanted to store the character age instead of inside of a string.",
        "we can store it inside of a number so",
        "I could just type out fifty.",
        "and when we're storing a number we don't need these quotation marks",
        "you only need that quotation mark",
        "when you're storing a string so if I wanted to a number I can just",
        "write it out like this,",
        "and in addition to using whole numbers I can also use decimal numbers.",
        "so I could say like fifty point five six seven eight",
        "to one three",
        "and pythons are going to be able to store",
        "that number as well.",
        "you can store all different types of numbers",
        "and we can also store",
        "what's called a boolean value",
        "and a boolean value is essentially a true or false value.",
        "and there's a lot of instances in programming where we're going to want to represent",
        "true or false",
        "data",
        "for example I can have a variable called like",
        "his mail",
        "and this would tell me whether or not someone was a male,",
        "and in my case it will be true because I'm a guy right so I can",
        "actually this needs to be",
        "capital",
        "so",
        "I could sort of value of either true",
        "or",
        "false.",
        "and actually if we were naming this in python",
        "we want to use an underscore or so I would say",
        "is underscore mail",
        "and this can be either true or false",
        "so",
        "true or false values is maybe not something that you're used to dealing with like in the real world",
        "but",
        "in programming we're going to be using a true or false values",
        "all the time they're super important so",
        "like I said there's three basic types of data that we can work with in python there's",
        "strings which is just like a plain text,",
        "numbers which would be like either decimal numbers or whole numbers like this,",
        "and there's true or false",
        "values.",
        "and these are the basic types of data I mean there's a bunch of other types of data that we can use but I would say ninety nine percent of the time.",
        "as a new user",
        "in a new programmer to python,",
        "you're just going to be dealing with these",
        "three types of data",
        "so",
        "those are the basics",
        "of the data",
        "and",
        "also with variables",
        "and you're going to be using variables",
        "all the time in python so you definitely want to practice up and get comfortable",
        "using them",
        "in this tutorial are talks you guys about working with strings in python.",
        "now what the most common types of",
        "data that we're going to be working with in python is going to be strings",
        "and strings are basically just",
        "plain text so any text",
        "that we want to have inside of our program",
        "we can store inside of a string.",
        "so I wanna talk to you guys about all the cool things we can do with strings and we're basically just going to get a",
        "full introduction into why strings are awesome.",
        "so over here,",
        "I'm just going to actually print out",
        "a strings I'm just going to say print",
        "and",
        "inside of these parentheses.",
        "I can type out a string",
        "in order to create a string I need to use quotation marks so I can make an",
        "open and close quotation marks",
        "just like that",
        "now",
        "inside",
        "the quotation mark I can put whatever text",
        "I want the string to have so we could say like",
        "draff",
        "academy.",
        "and so now we have a string",
        "with the text",
        "draff academy inside of it",
        "so if I run my program.",
        "now down here we're going to print out draff academy as you can see,",
        "and when we have these strings there's actually a bunch of cool things that we can do with them so",
        "one thing I could do would be to create a new line inside of the string so if I wanted I could come over here,",
        "and I could save backslash",
        "n",
        "and you can see it got highlighted in a different color.",
        "and what this is gonna do is it's actually going to insert a new line into the string so now it's going to say draff on one line",
        "and academy on another line.",
        "so I'm gonna click play.",
        "and you'll see down here we just get draff academy,",
        "an addition to the backslash",
        "n",
        "I could also use",
        "a backslash",
        "quotation marks so",
        "if I wanted to put a quotation mark inside of my string.",
        "I can't just put a quotation mark like that",
        "because pythons going to think that I'm trying to end",
        "this strength.",
        "so if I want to include a quotation mark I can just use this",
        "special backslash character",
        "and that's called the escape character and it",
        "basically just tells python that",
        "whatever character comes after it we want to",
        "render a literally so",
        "when I say backslash",
        "quotation mark.",
        "it basically means like",
        "hey python",
        "I want to point out a quotation mark.",
        "and so now we'll be able to print",
        "out",
        "a quotation mark",
        "right there.",
        "I can also use this to print out of backslash so if I needed to put out a backslash.",
        "I could see backslash,",
        "and",
        "it'll just print out a normal backslash now",
        "so you can see just like that so",
        "if you want and you can use that backslash to make",
        "new lines or pronounce quotation marks,",
        "or you can just use it as a normal",
        "backslash",
        "in addition to just typing out a string here I could also create a string",
        "variable.",
        "so I could come down here",
        "up here and we can create a variable and let's call it",
        "phrase.",
        "and I'm going to set it",
        "equal to",
        "drop off a colony,",
        "so I can",
        "store this string value inside of a variable called phrase",
        "and then when I want to print",
        "out that variable,",
        "or I want to access that string variable.",
        "I can just",
        "type the name of",
        "the variable.",
        "and you'll see that it's going to print out the value that was stored inside of it.",
        "I can also use something called concatenation",
        "and concatenation is basically the process of taking a string and",
        "appending another string onto it.",
        "so I could come over here and I could say phrase,",
        "and I can say",
        "plus.",
        "and now I can add in another string so I could say like",
        "is cool.",
        "and now this is going to say",
        "druff academy",
        "is",
        "cool,",
        "so I'm basically appending another string",
        "onto another one they call that concatenation.",
        "and so in addition to doing all that stuff we can also use a special thing is called",
        "functions",
        "and a function is basically just a little block of code that we can run",
        "and it will perform a specific",
        "operation for us,",
        "so we can use functions to modify our strings.",
        "we can also use functions to get information about our strings.",
        "so",
        "I'm gonna show you guys a couple common functions we can use with the strings.",
        "and",
        "they're actually going to do awesome stuff so",
        "in order to access one of these functions I can just say phrase and then I can say",
        "dot.",
        "and",
        "I'm gonna show you guys a function that we can use to convert this",
        "string entirely into lowercase so I could just say phrase dot lower.",
        "and I'm going to want to type an",
        "open and close parentheses,",
        "and this will take this phrase,",
        "it'll take my string and it will convert it to lower case.",
        "so you can see now we just have a draft academy done here but it's entirely in lower case.",
        "I could also do the same thing for upper case so I could say phrase dot",
        "upper",
        "and this will convert the entire string into",
        "upper case so you can see now it's",
        "entirely upper case.",
        "so in addition to",
        "converting the string into upper case",
        "lower case",
        "I can also",
        "check to see if a string is entirely upper case are entirely lowercase.",
        "so for example I could say phrase dot",
        "is upper.",
        "and this is going to give me back a true or false value",
        "so it's going to be true",
        "if the string is entirely upper case",
        "or false",
        "if it's not.",
        "and you can see here we're getting a false value because this",
        "is an",
        "upper case",
        "I can also use these functions in combination with each other so for example,",
        "I could say phrase",
        "dot",
        "upper",
        "and that a",
        "parentheses",
        "and then after this I can say",
        "dot",
        "is upper",
        "and now what it's going to do is it's going to run this",
        "upper function,",
        "it's going to convert it into upper case.",
        "and then it's going to run this",
        "is upper function right after that",
        "and you'll see now we're going to get a true value back because it will have converted the whole thing into upper case.",
        "so you can see now we're getting a true value so",
        "the news these functions",
        "one after another it can be really useful.",
        "and there's a few other ones that I want to show you so we can also",
        "figure out the length",
        "of",
        "this string so",
        "if I wanted to figure out how many characters were inside of this",
        "string I could just say",
        "l e n",
        "and I'm actually going to make an",
        "open parentheses,",
        "and I'm going to make a close parentheses.",
        "so I'm essentially saying",
        "alien and this is another function it's the length function.",
        "and inside of this alien function I'm actually passing",
        "this",
        "phrase variable",
        "basically giving the length function this and it's going to spit out a number so tell me how many",
        "characters are inside of this string.",
        "as you can see here we get fifteen because there's fifteen characters inside of draff academy.",
        "so that's how you can get the whole length of the string and that's going to be really useful as we go forward in python.",
        "we can also get",
        "individual characters inside of a string so",
        "imagine if I wanted to just grab one of these characters like imagine if I wanted to",
        "figure out what the first character in the string is",
        "we're going to actually use",
        "and open a closed",
        "square bracket",
        "just like that.",
        "and in here I can specify the",
        "index of the character that I want to graph.",
        "so if I wanted to grab the first character in the string",
        "I can put in a zero.",
        "so if I say phrase",
        "square bracket zero,",
        "this is going to give me that capital g",
        "and you can see down here",
        "that's what gets printed out.",
        "now I want to point something out",
        "in",
        "python.",
        "when we're working with strings.",
        "a string",
        "gets indexed",
        "starting with zero.",
        "so you'll notice that in order to access this g.",
        "I had to put a zero in here.",
        "that's because in python.",
        "when we use indexes on a string we start with zero",
        "so if python is counting the characters",
        "or its indexing the characters in a string it's going to start with zero so it's going to say",
        "g is zero",
        "I as one are as to",
        "a history.",
        "so we would say that g is at position",
        "zero in the string.",
        "I is at position one",
        "r is at position two",
        "a's at position three etc.",
        "so we start counting",
        "at zero.",
        "so if I wanted to access",
        "the first",
        "character in the string.",
        "this g I have to say phrase",
        "zero and that's just a special thing",
        "in python and actually most programming languages",
        "do that so they'll start with",
        "zero.",
        "so for example if I wanted to access this",
        "ei,",
        "I'm going to have to put",
        "zero",
        "one",
        "two three so I put three inside of here",
        "now will be able to access that first",
        "a.",
        "as you can see we get an",
        "a right here,",
        "so this",
        "is actually really useful being able to grab a specific character inside of a string",
        "and you're gonna be using it",
        "that a lot as we go forward and python",
        "is also another really awesome function that we can use and it's called the",
        "index function.",
        "and basically what the index function will do is it'll tell us",
        "where a specific",
        "character or string is located",
        "inside of our strings like unsafe phrase",
        "dot",
        "index.",
        "and",
        "I can actually give this a value so sometimes when we use these functions in python,",
        "we can actually give them information so I can give this",
        "of value",
        "and we would call this passing a parameter so",
        "I would call a value that I would give to a function",
        "a parameter and you'll hear that word a lot.",
        "so",
        "for example I can say inside of here",
        "capitol g,",
        "and now this is going to return",
        "the index",
        "of",
        "the capitol g inside of our string",
        "so it should give us back",
        "a zero because g is at the zero of index",
        "and you'll see down here that we get a zero because that's where g is.",
        "so for example if I put in",
        "a inside it here like the lower case",
        "a",
        "it should give me zero one two three",
        "because that's where the first",
        "aid is inside of this string,",
        "so I can click the play button",
        "and you'll see it's giving us",
        "a three.",
        "you can also put actual words in here so for example I could put like",
        "academy in here,",
        "or I could even just put like",
        "a c a d.",
        "and this is going to tell me where this starts",
        "inside of my string so when I click play,",
        "it's going to give me an",
        "a",
        "because",
        "that's where",
        "a cat and he starts right",
        "zero one two three four five six seven",
        "eight",
        "if I put something in here that wasn't in the strings of for example if I put a z in here,",
        "that's not in here.",
        "it's actually going to throw an error so when I play this you'll see that we get this error down here",
        "because",
        "the z is not found inside of our program so",
        "that the next function again can be really useful we'll be using that a lot.",
        "there's also one more than I want to show you which",
        "is called replace",
        "so we can say phrase not replace",
        "and in here I can actually give this",
        "two parameters so I can give this replace function",

        "with numbers I'm going to show you guys",
        "all of that in this video it's gonna be awesome so",
        "first thing we can do is",
        "we can actually just like print out a number.",
        "so if I want to write a number in python it's really easy I basically just write the number so I could say like print",
        "too.",
        "and this is just going to print the number two out onto the screen,",

        "oh nine",
        "eight seven",
        "a negative number and",
        "python to be able to handle that just fine too.",
        "in python we can also use",
        "basic arithmetic so I could do things like addition subtraction multiplication",
        "fancy like",
        "three",
        "plus four",
        "and now this is going to print this out or was he like three plus",
        "four point five.",
        "and this will be able to print out the answer so we get seven point five.",
        "and we can do a dish in we can do subtraction.",
        "we can do division",
        "or we could do like multiplication as well so you can",
        "pretty much do whatever you want inside of python,",
        "and if you want to make more complex mathematical equations we can also use",
        "things to specify order of operations",
        "so I could use parentheses.",
        "so for example if I said three times four plus five",
        "what python is gonna do is it's gonna multiply three and four together so it's going to be twelve and then we'll add five to that so we should get seventeen.",

        "so you can see we can use those parentheses to specify order of operations so I could make like a very complex",
        "little equation here and just by using numbers and parentheses.",
        "we can also",
        "use one other operation which is called the modulates operator so I could say like",
        "ted,",

        "three and this is actually read",
        "ten",
        "mod",
        "three",
        "and basically what this is gonna do is it's going to take the first number",
        "divided by the second number,",
        "and it's going to spit out the remainder.",
        "so it's basically going to say",
        "ok",
        "ten divided by three.",
        "that's going to be three",
        "with a remainder of one.",
        "so this is going to give us the remainder.",
        "and",
        "you'll see down here we get one because",
        "that's the remainder of ten divided by three",
        "that modulates operator can come in handy quite a bit.",
        "we can also store these",

        "my underscored gnome",
        "and we'll just store a value",
        "of let's say like five and here",
        "is why have you come down here and I can just print out my underscore numb.",
        "and we'll be able to print that number out to the screen",
        "just fine.",
        "so in addition to doing things like a basic arithmetic",
        "we can also",
        "do some other stuff so one thing I could do is I could actually convert this number into a string.",
        "so if I wanted to convert this number into a string I can just say s t r",
        "and I can put the number that I want to convert",
        "inside of these parentheses.",
        "and so what's going to happen now is this number is going to be converted",

        "now pythons gonna have a problem with this.",
        "it's not going to allow us to do that you can see we get an",

        "anytime you want to print out a number",

        "so when I click the play button,",
        "you'll see it's just giving us five because five is the absolute value of negative five,",
        "I can use a few other functions there is another one",
        "which is called",
        "pau at so it says p o w",
        "and I'm actually not going to use this variable we just as a normal number",
        "and",
        "this function is going to allow us to pass it",
        "to pieces of information so I can give this function",
        "two pieces of information.",
        "the first is going to be",
        "like a number.",
        "and the second is going to be the power that I want to take that number two so I could say like three",
        "comma",
        "two",

        "you know",
        "some crazy number like",
        "we could pass in a four",
        "and we can raise it to the power of six,",
        "and so we should get like a pretty big number here",
        "and you can see we get four thousand ninety six so",
        "this",
        "power function is really useful for taking numbers to specific",
        "powers.",
        "so in addition to using this power function we can also use another function which is called",
        "max.",

        "I cannot see is another function called",
        "men and this is going to do the opposite so now instead of printing out the max number it's going to print out the smallest number.",

        "another cool function is called the round function",
        "and this is going to allow us to round a number so it's just going to follow like standard rounding rules.",
        "so if I said like three point to inside of here",

        "down to just normal three",
        "but if I said like three point seven.",
        "it's going to round it up to four so that'll allow you to round a number.",
        "so there's a few other functions that I want to show you guys but in order to",
        "get access to them I'm actually going to have to do something called",
        "importing",

        "import",
        "and this star and basically what this is gonna do is it's going to",
        "go out and it's going to grab",
        "a bunch of different math functions that we can use so",
        "I already showed you guys a few of the zipper math functions but there's actually a bunch more.",
        "and in order to access them we're going to need to include this line of code inside of our file.",
        "so once we have that now I can access a few other so",
        "is another function which is called the floor method and it's just",
        "f l o r",
        "and what this will do is it'll basically just grab",

        "lowest number so it's essentially just going to chop off this decimal point.",
        "and you can see over here now",

        "and that's just going to do the exact opposite so that's just going around the number up",
        "no matter what so",
        "no matter what will always get for",
        "which we have a three point whatever here",
        "and there's another one which is called square root so it's just asking you our team",

        "thirty six.",

        "and",
        "like I said you know there's",
        "tons of documentation on all this stuff so you can just look up",

        "so",
        "we basically have our entire program written out here",

        "eight point",
        "three is definitely not fifty eight points three",
        "and here's what happened",
        "when we get input from a user",
        "by default.",
        "python is just going to convert",
        "it into a string,",
        "so it doesn't matter what we put",
        "down their when we're entering the numbers",

        "basically just coming over here",
        "and when we add the two numbers together",
        "I can use a special python function",
        "in order to convert those",
        "strings",
        "into numbers.",

        "int",
        "so I could say I auntie.",
        "I can make an",
        "open parentheses and I can make a close parentheses",

        "into an",
        "integer",
        "number,",
        "and an",
        "integer number is basically a whole number so it's like one two three four or five so it's a,",
        "it's a whole number another word that can't have a decimal point,",
        "so what I could do is I could say",
        "I n t,",
        "and I could put these",
        "inside of",
        "parentheses.",
        "and now what this is gonna do is it's going to convert both of these numbers into",
        "integers in other words",
        "into",
        "whole numbers that don't have decimals,",
        "and it's going to add them together and will print out the result so why don't we do that",
        "we'll just see if this works I'm gonna",
        "click the play button",
        "and down here we'll enter our first number sums can enter into four",
        "and then I'll answer in a five",
        "and now you can see it's printing out the correct answer four plus",
        "five",
        "and so that's essentially our basic calculator.",
        "but we do have one",
        "problem with this calculator salmon run it again and I'll show you guys with that problem is",

        "a decimal number so we'll add four point three and five point five.",
        "you'll see that we're getting this error.",

        "so if",
        "I put decimal numbers inside of there it's going to break the programs.",
        "there's another function we can use",
        "instead of an",
        "n we can say float",
        "and a float",
        "is basically just a number that has decimal so it's a decimal number",
        "so I can convert both of these guys into floats",
        "and now I'll be able to use decimal number so I can click play.",
        "and I can just enter into number so I could say like four",

        "so",

        "I'm going to paste it down below",

        "this.",
        "and finally what is adding that celebrity.",
        "so",
        "now we have a prequel mallet",
        "and it should be functional everything should work it looks like it's",
        "good to go so",
        "let's come over here and we'll run our program",

        "we can play are a little mad libs games so",

        "so",
        "when I click enter what should happen is we should get our mad libs",

        "and obviously you know,",
        "the more,",

        "the better the madlib could be and we could store as many, y'know, variables up here as we wanted.",
        "this was just a very simple madlib we only took in",
        "three inputs but you know you could see how you could take something like this and create a little mad libs game so",
        "your homework for this lesson is to go off and make your own madlib game hopefully one that's a little bit funnier than mine.",
        "but that's the basics",
        "of creating a mad libs game in",
        "python",
        "in this tutorial on its artsy guys about working with lists in python.",
        "a lot of times when you're programming in python you're going to be dealing with large amounts of data,",

        "when you're dealing with large amounts of data you want to make sure that you can",
        "manage it and organize it properly,",
        "and the list is essentially just a structure that we can use inside of python",
        "to store the lists of information so we can take",
        "a bunch of different data values we can put them inside a list",
        "and it allows us to organize them and keep track of them",
        "a lot",
        "easier.",
        "so generally you would create a python less than you would put a bunch of",
        "related values",
        "inside of that list and then you can use it throughout your program so",
        "I'm actually eyes are just the basics of using lists we're going to look at some of the common use cases and",
        "really just get you up to speed with what lists are and why they're useful so",
        "over here in my program",
        "I'm actually going to",
        "create a list and",
        "we create a list",
        "a lot might we create a python",
        "it's like a normal python variable so",
        "the first thing we want to do and we're making a list",
        "is give it",
        "a name so we want to give it a descriptive name",
        "something that's going to basically describe what's inside the list",
        "in my case for",
        "this example let's make a list",
        "of like friends so we could say here's a list of all my friends so I can say",
        "friends",
        "and I'm going to set this",
        "equal to",
        "the list of values",
        "that represent my friends",
        "and we want to create a list we can use these",
        "opening closed square brackets.",
        "so whenever you use these open and closed",
        "square brackets python basically nose",
        "okay they want to store a bunch of values",
        "inside of this list.",
        "so why don't we go ahead and start adding some values so we can say like my friends are like",
        "tavern,",
        "karen",
        "and say jim.",
        "so here I have three values",
        "inside of my friend's array.",
        "so when we're creating a normal variable in python generally we just give it one value",
        "right",
        "now to create a variable",
        "I would give it",
        "one value may be a string or a number or a boolean.",
        "but when we make lists",
        "were able to store multiple values",
        "inside of the same like",
        "little item inside of the same",
        "object right",
        "and then what I can do is I can access these individual items",
        "inside of my program so",
        "inside of this friends",
        "list were basically storing",
        "all of these different values and that can be really useful so",
        "now that we've stored some values let's talk about what you can put",
        "inside of a list so you can really put any piece of",
        "information in python",
        "we could put things like",
        "strings, numbers, or booleans",
        "so if I wanted instead of just putting strings here I could change like one of these to a number",
        "and I could change one of these to a boolean",
        "and wouldn't matter",
        "python's going to be fine with that.",
        "let's change it back to strings just",
        "for the sake of the example so",
        "now that we've created our list",
        "how can we access",
        "individual elements",
        "inside of this list",
        "it's a good question.",
        "I'm going to go ahead and print something out to the screen.",
        "the first thing we can do is we can just",
        "print out the actual list so",
        "I can just say print friends",
        "and then when I run this program.",
        "if we look down here in the console you can see it's just",
        "printing out the actual list of friends right,",
        "but let's say that I wanted to print",
        "out a specific",
        "element inside of this list",
        "where I can actually refer to elements by their",
        "index",
        "so",
        "each one of the elements inside of this list",
        "has a particular",
        "index",
        "and the index is actually started zero so we would say that this",
        "first element in the list kevin",
        "has an index of zero,",
        "we would say that this",
        "other element",
        "karen has an index of one.",
        "and this",
        "third element jim would have an index of two.",
        "so even though",
        "jim is technically the third element",
        "inside of the list.",
        "it has an index of two",
        "and that's because we start indexing at index position",
        "one.",
        "and so that is kind of how this work and that's how list",
        "indexes work",
        "so",
        "if I wanted to",
        "access a specific element inside of my friends list.",
        "I can just referred to it by its",
        "index.",
        "so over here after which I bought friends I'm just going to tape an",
        "open and closed square bracket,",
        "and inside",
        "this open and close square bracket",
        "I want to put the",
        "index",
        "of the element",
        "inside the list",
        "that I want to access",
        "so fallen to access",
        "this guy right",
        "here this element.",
        "I can just put a zero.",
        "so I can say friends",
        "zero.",
        "and now when I run my program,",
        "it's just going to print out that value it's just going to pronounce",
        "cabin,",
        "if only to access this",
        "gem value over here I can put a",
        "two",
        "and that will give us that",
        "jim value",
        "you can see right there,",
        "so we can access elements",
        "based off of",
        "their index",
        "we can also",
        "access elements",
        "based off of their index",
        "from the back of the list",
        "so",
        "for example if I said",
        "negative one inside of here,",
        "this is going to give me access to this",
        "value right here for jim.",
        "and you can see that's what it does so when we use negatives it starts indexing from the back of the list so if I start at negative two,",
        "this is going to give us",
        "karen",
        "so you can use the negatives to access",
        "items at the back of the list.",
        "just keep in mind though and this is kind of an",
        "interesting",
        "we said we would say this first element here is index position zero",
        "right",
        "but we would say the first element at the back of the list",
        "is index position",
        "negative one so",
        "just keep that in mind.",
        "so there's actually other ways that we can access like just",
        "portions of this list so for example,",
        "let's say I just wanted to select the last two elements in this list and I didn't want us like the first one",
        "will in here I can just say one",
        "with a colon,",
        "and this will grab the element at index position one and",
        "all of the elements",
        "after that so now we should describe",
        "jim and karen",
        "or carrying gym in that order.",
        "I could also specify a range.",
        "so actually let me out in a couple other elements,",
        "just so that we can illustrate this better.",
        "so are in two more names.",
        "so if I wanted to I could select like",
        "the element and exposition one",
        "up to the element at index position three so",
        "it's going to grab",
        "this one says one,",
        "two",
        "and it's actually not going to grab the third one so it's it's going to grab all the elements",
        "up to but not including three so it'll grab",
        "karen and",
        "jim,",
        "let's go ahead and run this and you can see it grabs canon japan so",
        "you can either just put like",
        "one with a colon after it and it'll grab that",
        "in exposition in everything after it or even specify like",
        "arrange that you want to grab from.",
        "so that's how we can access",
        "elements inside of this list",
        "but we can also a modify elements",
        "so for example",
        "I could come down here.",
        "let's say I want to modify this value right here karen",
        "we'll all you have to do is just access that elements I could say",
        "friends",
        "and",
        "karen is that at position of one",
        "and I could change this to whatever I want so I could say friends",
        "in that position one is equal to",
        "mike ?",
        "and now",
        "when we print out friends",
        "and at position one",
        "that value is going to be updated so it's just going to say",

        "karen",
        "so it can be really useful to modify values inside of",
        "arrays",
        "so it can be really useful to modify values inside of python lists.",
        "so those are kind of the basics of working with lists",
        "in python and actually in the next tutorial monastery guys",

        "that we can use these less we're going to learn how to link",

        "these lists but for now this has just been sort of like",
        "the basics of working with lists",
        "in this tutorial I wanna talk to you guys about using",
        "functions with lists",

        "reset the less than get rid of",

        "now would give me the index",

        "oscar.",

        "an error",
        "because it's as",
        "mike is not in the list",
        "so that's an easy ways you figure out if a specific element inside of the list.",
        "and if it is,",
        "then you know what index its app,",
        "you can also count the number of similar elements in the list so",
        "I'm actually going to come down here copy this",
        "gem element",
        "and will add another",

        "shows up",

        "jim",

        "let's say for the purposes of this tutorial we want to create a function",
        "that says \"hi\" to the user so",
        "the one task that our function performs as basically just saying hi to",
        "whoever is writing the program so",
        "over here,",
        "if I want to write a function the first thing I have to use",
        "is a keyword in python it's called \"def\" of",

        "both are considered like",
        "good practices and python and a lot of times",

        "you'll notice that when I clicked enter my",

        "and that",
        "having one of the rules and python is like",

        "this little like marker over here",
        "is basically saying like",
        "oh yeah",
        "that's inside the function.",
        "but then when I write code",
        "over here that is like",
        "not at the same",
        "indentation level as this stuff.",
        "it's no longer considering it inside the function so",

        "some text it's going to say",
        "hello.",
        "user.",
        "so this is a very simple function obviously we just have one line of code and",

        "hello user so were executing the code",
        "inside of the function.",
        "and I want to show you guys just one more thing here",
        "just talking to you guys about how these functions actively work so",
        "up here I'm going to print top",
        "and then down here",
        "I'm going to print",
        "bottom.",
        "so I wanna show you guys the flow of",
        "these functions inside the program so when I",
        "run this program",
        "you'll see",
        "we print out top",
        "hello user",
        "and then bada.",
        "so essentially what's happening is",
        "when python goes through and",
        "executes this",
        "program,",
        "it goes over here to this first line it says",
        "ok",
        "we want to print out the word top",
        "and then it goes down here and it says",
        "ok we want to execute the say high function",
        "so python actually jumps",
        "up",
        "and it goes over this say high function,",
        "and it's going to execute",
        "all of the code",
        "inside of this function so",
        "it's going to go through execute all this code.",
        "and then once it's done executing all the code and the function,",
        "it's going to jump back",
        "down here and it's going to move onto the next line which is bottom so that's how like the flow of functions,",
        "again with functions generally when we're",
        "naming these functions",
        "and",
        "you want them to be named",
        "in all lower case,",
        "and",
        "usually when we're naming stuff in python",
        "if there's two or more words we're going to use an",
        "under space",
        "or an underscore in between them.",
        "so I can write this out as say under score high.",
        "but",
        "in a lot of situations though if I have a function like this where the name is really short",
        "and might just be easier to leave it",
        "without an underscore but",
        "why we've spent on scoring now just to be a",
        "super python official.",
        "all right so now",
        "we can actually make these functions a little bit more powerful and what we can do is we can give them information.",
        "so a lot of times when we write a function we're going to want to have additional information that gets",
        "passed in.",
        "and these are called parameters",
        "so a parameter is a piece of information",
        "that we give to",
        "the function,",
        "so",
        "over here I can actually specify that this function needs to receive some parameters so I can basically say like",
        "hey if you're gonna call this function,",
        "you need to give us some information,",
        "you need to give us some parameters",
        "and all I have to do to do that has just type out the name of the parameter that I want to receive so why don't we allow the",
        "code calling this function to tell it what name to say hi to",
        "up here I can just say name",
        "and basically what this means is it means whenever I call this say high function",
        "we have to give it a name.",
        "so down here if I was to call this",
        "I have to include a name in here so I can say like",
        "mike.",
        "and what we can do now is we can actually access this parameter or this variable",
        "inside of our",
        "function so I could come over here and instead of saying hello user.",
        "I could say hello",
        "name",
        "and basically what this is gonna do is it's just going to say hello to whatever name got passed in here",
        "so I'm actually gonna copy this",
        "and",
        "we will",
        "do this twice also hello my kilo",
        "steve",
        "and now when I run this program",
        "you'll see that",
        "instead of just saying",
        "hello user",
        "it saying hello to whichever name",
        "I passed in to the function.",
        "so that's why this can be really useful right we can",
        "give the function information",
        "and depending on the information we give it",
        "it'll performance task",
        "a little bit differently.",
        "I could also",
        "include more than one parameter so you can I mean",
        "technically you could have as many parameters as you want",
        "so I can put another one in here would say",
        "age.",
        "and now I'm going to have to pass in an",
        "age",
        "along with these,",
        "so I'm just going to pass in",
        "age",

        "so we can say hello name",
        "you are",
        "age",
        "so I'm passing in two pieces of information.",
        "now when we run this program is going to call the function,",
        "and it's going to use both of those pieces of information so it's a healthy",
        "like you are thirty five hello steve you are seventy.",
        "so",
        "essentially you",
        "were writing out this one line of code which just prints out like hello to someone",
        "and were allowing this function to receive",
        "two parameter so the name in the age",
        "and depending on the name in the age,",
        "the function is going to print out",
        "hello a little bit",
        "differently.",
        "that's kind of the beauty of using function so",
        "you could pass anything you want into a function so for example,",
        "I could pass in a",
        "integer.",
        "instead of a string for the age.",
        "so like I could pass in a number.",
        "the only differences over here we're going to have to",
        "convert this into a string,",
        "but it's going to work.",
        "just the same,",
        "so you can pass in alm",
        "strings",
        "numbers bullion's",
        "arrays you can really pass",
        "any type of data",
        "into a",
        "function and it's going to work",
        "so",
        "you can see here we get the same result.",
        "so that's the basics of functions and as you go through on",
        "with python you're gonna you know",
        "being functions more and more,",

        "but sometimes when we call a function we're actually going to want to get",
        "information",
        "back",

        "so that can be like a particular value.",

        "down here,",
        "says",
        "twenty seven so we got the correct answer.",
        "so I can do this with anything wantonly cube like for something",
        "as an hour on this",
        "and you can see we're constantly getting the correct answer back",
        "so",
        "that's the basics of using this return statement it allows us to return a value back to",

        "so I just wanna illustrate this point a little bit further I'm going to go up here I'm actually going to create a variable",

        "the value",
        "that gets returned",

        "it's not in a store like",
        "cube for its going to store the value that gets returned from executing that function.",

        "input that they are given so",
        "depending on the data that we're using in the program",
        "are programs will be able to respond so when certain data is certain values we can do certain things",
        "and when other data is,",
        "other values",
        "you can do other things so",
        "you know",
        "your programs are essentially",
        "becoming a lot smarter",
        "and actually if statements",
        "are things that we as human beings deal with every day so",
        "you know as you go throughout your day generally you're dealing with if statements all the time so I want to kind of",
        "give you guys a brief introduction into if statements and we'll talk about some of the common if statements that you'd see in everyday life.",
        "and now we'll go ahead and do a really awesome example of the kind of like",
        "sure yeah",
        "what if statements can do for us.",
        "so",
        "over here in my text editor I just have this little text file",
        "and in here I wrote out a bunch of",
        "if statements",
        "that",
        "a lot of people will encounter on a daily basis so here's the first one it says I wake up",
        "if I'm hungry.",
        "I eat breakfast.",
        "so let's break this down a little bit up here it says",
        "if I'm hungry.",
        "and this is a condition.",
        "right",
        "this is either going to be true",
        "or it's going to be false,",
        "right",
        "if it's true,",
        "I'm going to go ahead and",
        "eat breakfast right",
        "if it's false",
        "under skin to skip whatever was in here and move on,",
        "writes that",
        "the basics of an if statement.",
        "we have a condition",
        "in this case",
        "if I'm hungry.",
        "if the condition is true,",
        "then we do the action so",
        "we eat breakfast.",
        "otherwise we just skip it.",
        "so down here we have another one.",
        "it says",
        "I leave my house.",
        "if it's cloudy.",
        "I bring an umbrella.",

        "I bring",
        "sunglasses.",

        "if it's cloudy.",
        "if that conditions true",
        "we're going to bring the umbrella.",
        "but",
        "in this case if the conditions false",
        "there is something else that we want to do",

        "but now if this conditions false",
        "then we're gonna go ahead and bring",
        "sunglasses",
        "so",
        "that's another example of an if statement it's a little bit more complex.",
        "finally I have one more down here and this one's even more complex it says I'm at a restaurant.",
        "if I want me.",
        "I order a steak.",
        "so if this conditions true",
        "we order the steak,",
        "but if this condition is false,",
        "then we're going to move on and we're actually going to check",
        "another condition.",
        "so I'm gonna say",
        "otherwise",
        "if I want pasta.",
        "I order spaghetti and meatballs.",
        "this is another condition.",
        "if this condition is true we get the spaghetti,",
        "if it's not true",
        "then finally we're going to move on down here",
        "and which is default to ordering the salad so",
        "all three of these if statements are",
        "valid if statements",
        "it's just",
        "they get more and more complex as we go down the list",
        "so",
        "hopefully that's",
        "you know",
        "kind of wrap your head around what if statements are we're basically specifying conditions.",
        "if those conditions are true we're going to do certain things",

        "we can check",
        "other conditions",
        "aren't so let's head over to our python file and we'll start writing some actual python.",
        "so in here in my app dot python file.",

        "if.",
        "and then",
        "I just need to type out",
        "a condition.",
        "so",
        "basically I would have to type out like",

        "like",
        "for example in",
        "the other page we are specifying like",

        "here we're just going to check to see",
        "if",
        "is male.",
        "so in other words",
        "if the person is male.",
        "so remember this has to be a",
        "lake",
        "it has to be able to be reducible to a true or false value.",

        "I said",

        "so it's just going to be blank down here.",

        "is true.",
        "we can also use another keyword in",
        "python which is called",
        "else",
        "and alice is basically going to be like",
        "otherwise so you remember,",
        "before we said",
        "if it's cloudy.",
        "I'll bring an umbrella,",
        "otherwise",
        "I'll bring sunglasses well this is going to be like our otherwise",
        "so I can say down here.",
        "else",
        "and now",
        "anything that I've put below else",
        "is going to get printed out when",
        "that condition",
        "isn't sure",
        "so long we just put",
        "you are not a male.",

        "we're able to cover both of these situations for this variable.",
        "if it's false we can cover that situation.",

        "we can cover that situation as well so it'll say",
        "you are a male,",
        "so that's pretty cool.",
        "but we can also make these more complex",
        "and actually before I talk about that you can put as much code as you want inside an if statement so I could have like",
        "dozens of lines of code if I wanted.",
        "I'm just giving you guys are very simple example",
        "so",
        "why don't we make this more complex and I'm gonna add another",
        "variable into the mix",
        "so I'm going to add another you know boolean attribute into this mix.",
        "I'm going to make another variable called",
        "is tall",

        "let's say I wanted to write an if statement that will check both of those variables.",

        "if they're not mail in their tall like",
        "I can write out a bunch of",
        "if statements",
        "to check",
        "the combination of these variables",
        "and so the way I can do that is by using one of",
        "two key words",
        "so",
        "the first keyword I want to show you guys is the",
        "or keyword.",
        "so I can come over here and I could say",
        "if",
        "is male",
        "or",
        "is",
        "underscore",
        "tall.",
        "and what this is basically going to do is it's going to say if the person is either male",
        "or",
        "if their tall,",
        "then we want to do something so",
        "this is only going to be true when one of these values",
        "is true",
        "when one or both of those values is true",
        "so down here we can actually put instead of you are a male we could put you are a male",
        "or tall or",
        "both",
        "that's going to be",
        "more appropriate.",
        "and then down here we would say you are",
        "neither male",
        "nor",
        "tall",
        "and that's because",
        "if we execute the code inside of this else",
        "that means that",
        "both of these guys are false",
        "rates I'm saying",
        "if they're male or their tall,",
        "we're going to execute whatever isn't here",
        "otherwise",
        "that means",
        "they're neither male",
        "nor tall we're just going to execute this down here so",
        "misery as how this works all",
        "click play.",
        "and these are both true so it's going to say you are a male or tall or both.",
        "if I was to set one of these to false",
        "so let's set his male eagle",
        "false.",
        "now,",
        "it's still going to say you are a male or tall or both.",
        "but if I set them both equal to false.",
        "now it's going to",
        "say you're neither male",
        "nor tall.",
        "so",
        "that's how the basics",
        "of using the or operator.",
        "and there's another operator we can use which is called",
        "and",
        "and basically a",
        "similar to",
        "or accept",
        "both of these",
        "conditions have to be true so",
        "this is basically saying",
        "if the person is male,",
        "and",
        "they're also tall,",
        "then we're going to execute whatever's in here so we could actually change this text",
        "to say",
        "you are",
        "a",
        "tall now",
        "because we know for a fact that",
        "if this is getting executed that are both male and tall.",
        "we can also change",
        "this print statement down here,",
        "this could say you are",
        "either",
        "not mail or not tall,",
        "or both.",
        "so",
        "you can see it's basically just saying that",
        "you're either",
        "not one of them or you're not both of them so",
        "we could the play button",
        "and you'll see because they're both false",
        "it's going to say you are either not mail or not tall or both.",
        "but if I make them both",
        "true,",
        "now it's going to say",
        "you are a tall male.",
        "if I was going to make one of these faster so let's make",
        "is tall false.",
        "now it's not going to execute this first print statement it's going to execute the one inside of the else,",
        "so to say you are either",
        "not mail are not tolerable.",
        "so",
        "that's the basics of",
        "and and or",
        "and you know",
        "you'll be using those a lot of them as you use your if statements,",
        "but there's actually one more",
        "thing we can do we can add in some more conditions",
        "so up here I'm checking",
        "if their mail and their tall,",
        "but what if I wanted to check if their mail and they're not tall",
        "so they're like a short male",
        "I can use another",
        "keyword in python",
        "called",
        "else f",
        "or really it's just typed out",
        "yes",
        "I am,",
        "and it stands for lcds.",
        "and after this we can put another condition so",
        "over here I'm going to check to see if their",
        "male and they're not tall,",
        "so I'm gonna say else if",
        "mayor",
        "ismail,",
        "and",
        "now I can type in",
        "not tall.",

        "not",
        "an",
        "open and close parentheses",
        "and saying",
        "is tall",

        "whatever is inside of here so if this was true,",
        "it's going to make it false and if this was false it's going to make it true.",
        "so basically that'll tell us whether or not their tall",

        "down here",
        "inside of here were basically just going to type out any of the code that we want to happen",

        "male,",
        "and",
        "there's actually one more condition that we want to check for which would be if they're not mail and their tall,",
        "so we can make one more",
        "lcs.",
        "and I'm actually just gonna copy this guy",
        "and we'll paste it down here.",

        "you are",
        "not a",
        "male",

        "so",

        "male or not taller both and actually we need to change this so this should say",
        "you are not a male",

        "for that situation so",
        "you basically see how we can use",

        "osoph's",

        "the first thing I want to do is",
        "when I go through this loop.",

        "or",
        "the user ran out of guesses",
        "and so",
        "there's two situations down here",
        "that we need to account for.",
        "and so I'm going to use an if statement to figure out",

        "if.",

        "if the user is out of guesses",
        "that I want to print,",
        "you lose",
        "so we're basically going to be like",
        "you lost the game.",
        "otherwise though",
        "if they're not",
        "out of gases.",
        "that means that they guessed the word correctly",
        "so we're just going to pronounce",
        "you win.",
        "all right so now we have all the logic for this little guessing game set up",

        "I'm just going to run this program.",
        "and now it's going to tell us to enter a guess",
        "so why don't we",
        "enter more guesses than we have so we're going to try to lose the game so I'm going to enter one gas",
        "two guesses.",
        "and now I'm on my final guess so if I don't get it here,",
        "we should actually lose the game.",
        "and you can see it says",
        "out of guesses you lose.",
        "so we were able to guess it",
        "in the number of trials that we had.",
        "let's run the program again",
        "and we'll try to win the game.",
        "so",
        "we'll get a couple wrong.",
        "let's say we're on our last gas and unlike",
        "okay I can do this",
        "so I type in the word and",
        "bam",
        "we won the game so,",
        "that's how we can basically create a game where we have",
        "a guess limit",
        "so",
        "this is a lot of code",
        "let me walk you guys through this one more time",
        "so you can just get a full understanding of what we're doing",
        "up here I created a few different variables",
        "we created this secret word variable",
        "and we created this guests variable.",
        "then",
        "we also created",
        "some more variable so we created this guests",
        "count variable.",

        "limit",
        "and gas limit is telling the program how many times the user can guess.",

        "count",
        "is less than the guests limit.",
        "in other words",
        "do they still have some guesses",
        "left",
        "if they do,",
        "then we're going to get the input from the user.",

        "out of gases",
        "and out of gases is going to tell us whether or not they have some guesses left.",
        "so this is equal to false.",
        "that means they have some guesses,",
        "if it's equal to true however it means",
        "no more dice",
        "no more guesses they are done",
        "so they lost the game.",
        "the last thing we needed to do is specify an additional condition up here.",
        "so",
        "we are going to keep looping through the code",
        "inside of this loop,",
        "as long as the conditions up here",
        "are true.",
        "so as long as they haven't guessed the word.",
        "and",
        "as long as they're not",
        "out of guesses.",
        "we are going to keep",
        "looping through.",
        "and so",
        "when eventually the user does break out of this loop,",
        "there's going to be two possible situations the first situation is that they ran out of guesses",
        "and so we want to check to see if that's the situation.",
        "I want to check to see if they're out of guesses.",
        "if they are",
        "will print out a lose message,",
        "if they're not,",
        "then they must have guessed it correctly so",
        "they win.",
        "and so that is how we can use while loops",
        "and",
        "if statements",
        "and also variables",
        "in combination with each other to build a pretty awesome",
        "guessing game",
        "in this tutorial on a talk show guys by using",

        "series of numbers",

        "for lives.",
        "so the way that we create a for loop",
        "is just by saying four.",
        "and now what I want to do is specify",
        "a",
        "variable",
        "and this variable is going to",
        "essentially represent",
        "a",
        "different value",
        "every time we go through this for loop",
        "and you guys will see",

        "one",
        "example of this would be like a string",

        "academy.",

        "I just want to create",
        "a",
        "basic list",
        "so I'm just going to call this",
        "number grid.",
        "and I'm going to set this equal to",
        "a normal let strangers like this",
        "now normally if we were creating a list I could just put in a bunch attributes and bunch elements right,",
        "and now all of these elements are inside of this number grid lists everybody's happy.",
        "but",
        "another thing I can do",
        "is I can make",
        "all of the elements",
        "inside of this number grid list",
        "lists",
        "so",
        "the first",
        "item",
        "in the numbered list is going to be a list.",
        "the second item and the number grew less is going to be a list",
        "etc.",
        "so I'm going to show you guys have to do that",
        "I can basically just come down here and",
        "why would normally put the first",
        "element in the list",
        "I can just create another array",
        "someone's going to make an open closed square bracket,",
        "and now",
        "I'm just going to say one two three",
        "and I can create the next item in my list",
        "I can say",
        "four five six,",
        "and then let's make another item in this list.",
        "I can say",
        "seven",
        "eight",
        "nine",
        "and finally we're going to put one more list inside of the number grid list",
        "and it's just going to have",
        "zero in it so",
        "inside of this numbered red lips write this",
        "high level overall list,",
        "we have",
        "four elements",
        "in",
        "all of those elements",
        "are",
        "themselves",
        "lists.",
        "so essentially what we're doing is we're creating a grid right",
        "this grid has one two three four rows",
        "and one",
        "two three carbons",
        "right",
        "for rose",
        "three columns and that's kind of like",
        "why these can be useful as we can create a grid like",
        "structure inside of python",
        "using",
        "two dimensional lists.",
        "so this is a pretty cool list structure.",
        "and I wanna show you guys,",
        "how it can access",
        "individual elements",
        "inside of this list structure so",
        "for example let's say I wanted to print out one of these values if they wanted to print out this one right here,",
        "the way I can access it is by saying",
        "number grid.",
        "and",
        "the first thing I want to do is make an open and closed square brackets",
        "and in here",
        "I want to put the",
        "index of the row that I want to access.",
        "so this would be like row zero",
        "because it's the zero of element in the array.",
        "this would be row on its it and exposition one",
        "this would be row to row three etc so I could put",
        "roses grow",
        "and now",
        "right next to this I'm going to make another square bracket,",
        "and I want to put the",
        "index of the column so",
        "this would be like column one",
        "column to column three.",
        "so",
        "I'm going to put it another zero",
        "because this is at the",
        "zero",
        "index",
        "of this first",
        "array so",
        "I've",
        "been zero zero here.",
        "now we can print this guy out to the screen",
        "and you'll see down here",
        "that we get that one",
        "so I can also do this for like for this eight for example so this is going to be",
        "zero one two",
        "can be row two and",
        "column one",
        "and now we should be able to print out that",
        "e.",
        "so that's basically how we can access elements inside of this",
        "two d",
        "list.",
        "the next thing I want to show you guys",
        "is",
        "a",
        "nested for loop",
        "nested poorly with the situation in mega said well we have",
        "a for loop",
        "inside of a for loop.",
        "and I'll show you how we can use this nested for loop",
        "in order to print out all the elements inside of this array so I've basically shown you guys on a parse through",
        "a",
        "two dimensional",
        "list or a two dimensional array.",
        "so basically we're going to create a normal for loop so I'm going to say four",
        "and I'm just going to say row",
        "in",
        "number grid.",
        "and I'm using the word row here because",
        "I'm kind of seeing",
        "these guys as rows right these are sort of horizontal rows",
        "in our little grid",
        "so for each of those rows for each of the",
        "elements",
        "inside of number grid.",
        "I want to loop through so I could actually just print out",
        "each row right now",
        "and it's going to print out all the rows inside of this",
        "list you can see down here",
        "we basically just get exactly what we have up there.",
        "but I want to be able to access",
        "each of these individual",
        "attributes",
        "inside of each of these",
        "array elements",
        "so",
        "we can actually create another for loop and am I put that for loop inside of here,",
        "so now I'm going to say four",
        "column",
        "in a",
        "row.",
        "and basically what this is going to give us is",
        "each",
        "individual",
        "column or each individual",
        "element inside of these",
        "arrays",
        "so for example inside of the arrays that are",
        "the elements of the number grid",
        "over that makes sense",
        "so",
        "down here.",
        "now we can just",
        "print",
        "out",
        "column",
        "and this should actually print out",
        "every single",
        "value inside of this two dimensional array.",
        "so let's go ahead and run this program.",
        "and down here you'll see that we're basically printing out",
        "one all the way down",
        "to",
        "zero",
        "so we're printing out all of the",
        "elements",
        "inside of",
        "all of the arrays inside of the number grid.",
        "so that's how we can use two dimensional lists and",
        "nested for loops together in both of those things",
        "are actually pretty handy in python",
        "in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to build a basic translator in",
        "python.",
        "so essentially we can",
        "take in",
        "a strings we can take him like a phrase or a word",

        "so",
        "over here I have this little file",
        "and it basically specifies this language",

        "and",
        "in the draft language",
        "all vowels",
        "become",
        "g",

        "and",

        "into",
        "c g t.",

        "obviously this is a pretty simple language but",
        "you get the point any vowel is going to become a",
        "g and then we'll get",
        "the draft language.",
        "so we're going to build",
        "a draft",
        "translator",
        "over here in our",
        "python file.",
        "let's",
        "start making this translator the first thing I'm going to do is just define a translate function.",

        "we want this to take",
        "one",

        "how can we translate",

        "the rules is basically just",

        "jeez.",

        "we're not allowed to do that right.",
        "if I took this and I put this down and out of this try block.",
        "and",
        "I just pasted it in here,",
        "it's going to get caught by this exception",
        "that we wrote down here so it's going to get caught by that accepts and when I run the program",
        "you'll see it says",
        "invalid input.",
        "but the problem is that we didn't",
        "input something that was invalid",
        "right",
        "we just divided by zero",
        "but it wasn't",
        "able to handle that.",
        "right so it could not divide by zero",

        "input even though it was because we divided by zero it's still printed this out.",
        "and this brings me up to another point is we can actually catch",

        "so for example",
        "in this case we got a division by zero error",
        "in this case we got",
        "an invalid input air I we we",
        "put something in that was wrong you",
        "can convert the value.",
        "so I can create two different except blocks to catch two different types of error so down here",
        "I can just make a space and I can specify the type of error that I want to catch.",
        "so when we divided by zero it was",
        "zero division air.",
        "so if I just put zero division error in here.",
        "now it's going to catch that zero division later so I can say",
        "divided by zero.",
        "I can also make another accepts I could say",
        "accepts",
        "and",
        "we can catch the other exception that we got so I think it was",

        "so that's kind of like how we can open and close the file.",
        "now let's talk about how we can get information from the far right",
        "there's no point having the file that we can't figure out what's in it",
        "so",
        "there's actually a few different functions that we can use",

        "but before I do that I want to show you guys how you can check",
        "to make sure that a file as readable.",
        "so before we do anything else generally is a good idea to make sure",
        "that it's possible to read this file.",
        "and there's",
        "a function",
        "inside of python we can use called",

        "in poorly file",
        "dot",
        "readable.",
        "and",
        "this is going to return a boolean value and it's going to tell us whether or not we can read from this file so I'm going to run my program",
        "and you'll see down here we get a value of true",
        "and that's because we set the file with",
        "a read",
        "mode so it's in read mode we can read from it.",
        "if I was to put",
        "a w here so if I put like right",
        "now",
        "redouble is going to be false because we can no longer read the file we can only write",
        "to the file so",
        "I'm going to",
        "change this back to our so we can just read it.",
        "so once you figure out whether or not the file can be read from",
        "let's",
        "actually read it so",
        "there's another function called employee file dot read and this is basically just going to spit out all the information in the files",
        "so when I run the program",
        "it's just going to spit out",
        "all of this",
        "information right all the information isn't that was in that file.",
        "I can also come down here and we could read an individual line inside this file so I can say employee filed dot",
        "read line.",
        "and what this is gonna do is it's gonna read an individual line",
        "inside of this file so",
        "now when I run this program you'll see it's just reading that first line in the file.",
        "and this red line function is actually just",
        "reading the first line and then it's basically like moving a little cursor onto the next line so",
        "if I was to copy this line of code,",
        "and then",
        "printed again down here",
        "I'm saying employee filed out read line.",
        "so it's going to read the first line",
        "and then when I say it again it's going to read",
        "the line after that so this is actually going to end up printing out the first two lines in the file.",
        "when I run this program you'll see we print out jim sales men",
        "and dwight salesman.",
        "so if I was to do this multiple times I could technically print out",
        "every line inside of this file.",
        "and you can see we can do that",
        "and so that can be pretty useful for reading multiple lines in a file but there's actually another function that is better at doing that.",
        "we can say instead of employee father",
        "read line we can say dot read",
        "lines.",
        "and what this is gonna do is it's going to take",
        "all of the lines inside of our file",
        "and put them inside of an array.",
        "and so now when I print this out you'll see we have this array down here it says",
        "jim sales men that's the first item in the array",
        "to white salesman",
        "the second",
        "item in the array.",
        "it's basically taking each line and putting it inside of an array.",
        "so if I want to access a specific line",
        "I can just refer to it by its index in the array so if I said one.",
        "now this is going to give us that",
        "do white salesmen line",
        "because that is at index position one inside of the array.",
        "you can also use this reliance function",
        "with a for loop",
        "so I could come up here and create a for loop",
        "is going to save four",
        "and we'll say",
        "employee",
        "and",
        "employee file",
        "and then for each employee we just want to print them out so",
        "it actually started",
        "we have to put employee file dot",
        "read",
        "lines up here",
        "and so now there's a loop through all the employees",
        "in this employee filed out read lines array.",
        "so we can actually just",
        "print out",
        "the individual employee",
        "and now this will print out all the employees",
        "inside of that files is basically printing out",
        "each line in the file.",
        "and that can be pretty useful.",
        "so you can use all of these different functions like read read line read lines",
        "readable you know there's a bunch of these different things that we can do to get information from a file.",
        "and so there's a lot of cases where you're going to want to be able to parse through information in a file and this is a",
        "awesome way to do it so",
        "just to recap in whenever you want to open a file and read from it you can just use this",
        "open function",
        "type in the name of the file and then the mode,",
        "which in our case is going to be r.",
        "then you can do all sorts of stuff with it and you always want to make sure that",
        "you close it when you've done that's just good practice so",
        "that's the basics of reading from files and hopefully you guys can",
        "use this in some way shape or form in the future.",
        "in this tutorial on to talk to you about writing and appending to files in",
        "python.",
        "so one of the cool things about python is it allows you to work with",

        "read all the information in it I could pass through it",
        "use that information to do certain things,",
        "but it isn't a reading a file I can also write a file and that's what I want to talk to you guys about today's writing new files and appending onto existing files",
        "over here I basically just have some code written out",
        "and this essentially just",
        "reads information from this employee's dot text file so you can see over here,",
        "I am specifying the mode which is",

        "all of the contents of the file and spitting it out on the screen.",
        "so I'm gonna click the play button over here,",
        "and",
        "you'll see that",
        "if this executes so it's printing out",
        "all of the",
        "lines of code in our text file so over here I'm in this employee's dot text file",

        "I want to",
        "append it to the files I want to say",

        "right",
        "when I was over here in my program",

        "if I come over here,",

        "you can see it's just",

        "a lot of these external modules are stored",

        "that a module names of",

        "and people now",
        "and install this",

        "that's sort of the ins and outs of using",
        "modules now again",
        "there's tons of these modules and",
        "I can be dozens and dozens of python",
        "courses covering each one of these modules,",

        "not",
        "all",

        "probation",

        "so",

        "I'm defining what a student",
        "is",
        "in our program.",

        "it has a major",

        "object.",
        "so",
        "just stick with me right now and just basically",
        "know that we have to do what I'm doing over here so I'm just going to say self dot meme",

        "this might not make a whole lot of sense",
        "right now",
        "but",
        "in a little bit",
        "this is gonna make",
        "total sense",
        "so",
        "now that I have this student class defined",
        "I can actually use this class",
        "inside of my other file so",
        "I'm gonna come over here into this app",
        "dot python file.",

        "the student data type and we basically said like hey a student has a name,",

        "create an actual student and give it some information.",
        "and that's called an",
        "object.",
        "so",
        "this",
        "student class over here",
        "is basically defining what a student",
        "is",
        "so a class is just like",
        "an overview of what the student data type",
        "is",
        "an object",
        "is an actual student",
        "so it's an actual student with a name a major and a gps.",
        "it's not just this template anymore it's",
        "actually like a student that we're representing inside of our program so",
        "in order to use that student class and create a student",
        "object I actually need to import that so",
        "all I have to do over here just say",
        "from",
        "student",
        "and this is referring to this",
        "student file.",
        "I can say",
        "import",
        "student",
        "and basically what this is saying is from the student",
        "file.",
        "I want to import the student class.",
        "so even though these are both student they're referring to different things so this is referring to the file.",
        "and this is referring to the actual student class.",
        "so now that we did this we can create a student so",
        "you can create an",
        "object of a class",
        "a lot like you would a normal variable so",
        "I can just give it a name",
        "I'm gonna call this",
        "student one",
        "and I'm going to set it equal to",
        "student",
        "and I'm gonna make an open and close parentheses",
        "and now",
        "inside of this parentheses.",
        "I want to give this student",
        "a name,",
        "a major",
        "a gps",
        "and ann",
        "is on probation",
        "value.",
        "so I'm going to say it will just create a fake student saw to say his name's",

        "and he's studying",
        "business",
        "and",
        "we want to give them a gps and maybe has like a three point",
        "one.",
        "and",
        "finally we want to say whether or not this student is on probation so why don't we say false.",
        "so basically what I'm doing is I'm",
        "saying that I want to create",
        "a student.",
        "so I want to actually create a student",
        "object and rubber an",
        "object",
        "is just",
        "an",
        "instance",
        "of a class.",
        "so the class is like an overall template it defines what a student is",
        "put an object",
        "is an",
        "actual student with",
        "actual information so",
        "we could call student one now",
        "this is a student",
        "objects.",
        "so I just want to show you guys,",
        "what this student object actually is and what we can do with it and then I'm going to talk some more about that",

        "from before so",
        "over here I'm just going to",
        "make a print statement",
        "inside of here I just want to print out",
        "student",
        "and",
        "what's cool about",
        "this",
        "student one object is I can actually access",
        "each of the attributes from inside of this object.",
        "so if I wanted to get the name of the student I could say student one dot name",
        "and now",
        "this is actually going to print",
        "out the student's name.",
        "so over here,",
        "you'll see it prints out",
        "jim",
        "if I wanted I could print out the students",
        "gps",
        "and it's going to print out the students",
        "gps",
        "three point one.",
        "so now that I created this",
        "student",
        "objects.",
        "I can actually access the information about the student",
        "so essentially I'm just created a student",
        "data type",
        "so I could create as many of these students as I wanted if I wanted I could create another student we could call it student too.",
        "and",
        "essentially we do the same thing we just give it different information so",
        "we could say lake",
        "pam",
        "and her major is",
        "art",
        "and she has like a",
        "two point five.",
        "and let's say that she is on probation.",
        "so now I have another student student too so if I wanted",
        "I could access information about that student we could say like student to dodgy p a",
        "and now this has given me",
        "the dpj of",
        "student too.",
        "so basically what I did was I created a student data type",
        "and I created student objects",
        "and now I'm able to represent a student",
        "inside of my program.",
        "so",
        "let's talk real quick about all this stuff over here because I didn't really explain it",
        "basically what's happening is",
        "when I come over here and I say student",
        "and I'm passing in all of these different values.",
        "those are getting passed into this",
        "init function.",
        "so remember I passed in a name",
        "I passed in a major at passing a gps.",
        "when we create that student",
        "we're actually calling",
        "this function.",
        "and when I pass in the name",
        "the major and the gps",
        "those values are actually getting stored over here in this name.",
        "this major this gps",
        "et cetera,",
        "right",
        "so I'm",
        "giving this",
        "student object.",
        "all of that information.",
        "and down here.",
        "what I'm doing",
        "is I'm",
        "saying",
        "self dot name",
        "as he put the name",
        "and basically what this means is",
        "the actual objects name",
        "is going to be equal to the name that they passed in",
        "so self dot name as an attribute",
        "of student,",
        "raises the student is storing a name the student is storing a major the student is storing and gps,",
        "but that's different from",
        "this name",
        "this major in this gps",
        "remember and these are all just values that I passed in",
        "there just parameters.",
        "so I need to take the values that I passed in",
        "and I need to assign them to the actual attributes of the object so I need to say",
        "ok.",
        "the name of the student is going to be equal to the name that we passed in",
        "one more time.",
        "the name of the student",
        "objects",

        "the student's gps",
        "is going to be equal to the gps that we passed in.",
        "that's basically what's happening here so when I say self",
        "is referring to the actual object so",
        "over here what I'm creating this",
        "student object.",
        "I'm giving it all of this information.",
        "it's taking that information and storing it as attributes",
        "for",
        "the object.",
        "so",
        "hopefully that makes sense I think that's about as clear as I can make it but",
        "the point is that now we have a student",
        "data type.",
        "so now I can represent a student",
        "inside of my",
        "python",
        "program",
        "and that's like a super powerful.",
        "and what's cool about classes and objects as you can do this with anything.",
        "so in this example we created a student class and then we created student objects off of that.",
        "but I can model",
        "any real world entity",
        "into this program I can model something like a phone",

        "I just kind of",

        "question",

        "create these questions is we need to import this question class on mckillop been here",

        "question",

        "yeah",
        "so it's",

        "in",

        "equal to",

        "the answer that the user entered in which is stored inside this variable.",
        "so we want to check to see if they got the question right.",
        "and I can do that using an",

        "if",
        "answer",

        "question dot",
        "answer",

        "that we're",
        "asking.",

        "plus",
        "equals one and this basically just means we're adding one",

        "the results I want to print out how the user did",

        "print",
        "and I'm basically just going up are not like hey you got like",
        "two out of three questions are you got five out of six questions right",
        "or you got zero out of ten questions right well",
        "what does per not how they did so",
        "to say to you got.",
        "and now I want to print out how many questions they got right",
        "so this is just going to be this score.",
        "and in order to print",
        "a number alongside of a string like this I'm going to have to say s t r,",
        "and then type in the number so say",
        "str score",
        "so basically say you got",
        "however many they got right",
        "out of so we use this little",
        "forward slash.",
        "and",
        "now we'll just say",
        "how many questions there were so we can say.",
        "and then I'm going to have to convert this to a string because it's going to be in numbers we can say string",
        "and then want to figure out how many questions were in that questions array so I can say.",
        "ellie ann",
        "and inside of here we can just say",
        "questions",
        "so this is kind of like",
        "this",
        "long state and just to turn out how many questions that were",
        "so that over here to say",
        "correct.",
        "so now we have this print statement.",
        "and it's just going to be printing out how many questions they got right.",
        "so let's see if",
        "this works the last thing I need to do is just call this",
        "run test function so I'll say",
        "run tests.",
        "and I'm just going to pass it that",
        "questions are ready to be created before so",
        "we created this questions array with all of these question",
        "objects inside of it.",
        "I'm basically just going to pass that into this run test",
        "function.",
        "so now let's run our program and",
        "see how we didn't hopefully",
        "we don't getting errors.",
        "there's a lot of code there so",
        "it's possible that we might.",
        "okay so this is what color are apples has a tough one I once put",
        "a.",
        "so we'll get the first question right ?",
        "what color are bananas.",
        "let's get the second question wrong",
        "so I'm going to say",
        "be bananas aren't magenta",
        "and we'll get the third question right so it says what color are strawberries",
        "output be cassettes the right answer,",
        "so now",
        "you'll see that our program prints out",
        "you've got two out of three correct.",
        "so not only did to ask us all the questions and get our input for each question",
        "but it also kept track of",
        "our score and it printed it out so",
        "why don't we run through the tasks one more time.",
        "and",
        "we'll just like",
        "get two wrong this time so we'll get this one wrong I'll get this one wrong and I get this one right.",
        "so now it says",
        "you got one out of three correct so",
        "say would actually great our test.",
        "and",
        "what's cool about the program we just wrote is",
        "if I wanted I could add another question into here",
        "and it would",
        "automatically be able to ask it so it doesn't matter how many questions we put in here",
        "it's just able to ask",
        "so",
        "really the point I was trying to make with this whole video was just how we can use something like a class",
        "in order to",
        "model a real world",
        "entity.",
        "so for example",
        "we created this question class.",
        "and we were able to store all the information",
        "about a question that we could ever needs were ill bizarrely the prompts and the answer,",
        "so we created our own question",
        "data type",
        "and then we were able to create a bunch of different questions,",
        "pass it into this ron test method,",
        "and it was able to grade the test and just run the test",
        "really easily so that's kind of the point.",
        "so hopefully this makes sense.",
        "you know this was a lot of code",
        "so if you don't fully understand what I did go back watch the video you know,",
        "try to cobble times on your own and see if you can create your own multiple choice test",
        "in this tutorial on talks you guys about",

        "in",
        "python so",
        "a class function is essentially a function that we can use",

        "over here I have this student dot pi file",
        "and",
        "inside of here I created a student class I was headed class student",

        "so",
        "what we can actually do is we can",

        "student objects could access it.",
        "so for example,",
        "I can come down here and create a function and",
        "let's say we wanted to create a function",

        "well",

        "if",
        "self dot gps.",

        "this is referring to like",

        "so",
        "that's essentially our little on honorable function and you can see it's a very small function,",

        "inheritance is basically where we can define a bunch of attributes and functions",
        "and things inside of a class,",
        "and then we can create another class and we can inherit all of those",
        "attributes.",
        "so I could basically",
        "have one class that has",
        "all the functionality of another class",

        "so it that's confusing don't worry I'm",

        "let me show you about some stop I have set up over here.",
        "I created this class",

        "and the chef can make",
        "a special dish.",
        "and whatever the chef makes a dish",
        "he basically just says",
        "the chef makes a chick in order the chef makes",
        "a salad",
        "or the chef makes barbecue ribs for this special dish.",
        "so basically just",
        "saying whatever the chef is doing so",
        "if I was to come over here to my app dot python file,",
        "you'll notice that I'm importing the",
        "chef",

        "now it's going to say the chef makes barbecue ribs so it because that's the chef's",
        "special dish.",

        "can do",

        "so the chinese chef is like a special",
        "schafroff it's very specific type of chef.",
        "but let's say that this chinese chef",
        "can do everything that the normal chef can do so the chinese chef can make chicken",
        "can make salad,",
        "and can also make",
        "a special dish.",
        "well if I wanted to give this",
        "chinese chef,",
        "all of that functionality.",
        "I could just come over here and I could copy all of these",
        "functions.",
        "and I can paste them in here",
        "and so now the chinese chef can do everything",
        "that the other chefs can do,",

        "deaf",

        "the chinese chef has this extra",

        "chicken.",

        "and you'll notice that it can do everything",
        "that",
        "the normal chef could do.",
        "so let's go back over to our app dot python file and I want to create",
        "a",
        "chinese chef",

        "object",
        "sit down here I'm going to make one arrow to say",

        "my chinese chef.",
        "we can print out this special dish so",
        "remember the chinese chef can do",
        "everything that the normal chef could do",
        "so if I say my chinese chef da",
        "make special dish.",
        "when I run this program you'll see",
        "the",
        "regular chef is making barbecue ribs and the chinese chef is making orange",

        "you can also",
        "make",
        "fried rice.",
        "but here's the problem right when I go over here to this",
        "chinese chef dot pie.",
        "I went I wanted to use all of the functionality that was inside this",

        "I actually had to copy and physically paste.",
        "all of these functions down",
        "into this file right",
        "and that's kind of a drag.",

        "we have to copy and I have the pace.",
        "all of those inside of this chinese chef",
        "and this is where we can use something called inheritance",
        "so instead of having to copy and paste",
        "all of these functions.",
        "I could just inherit these functions",

        "chef class",
        "and in order to do that,",
        "I can actually just get rid of all of these,",
        "and I can come over here",
        "and",
        "right next to where I'm saying class chinese chef",
        "inside of the parentheses I can say the name of the class that I want to inherit from so I can just say a chef.",
        "and I'm also going to have to import this song to come over here and we'll say",
        "from",
        "chef",
        "in poor",
        "shelf.",
        "so basically what this is saying is",
        "inside of this chinese chef.",
        "I want to be able to use all of the functions that are contained",
        "inside of the chef class",
        "so say that one more time",
        "inside of this chinese chef class",
        "I want to be able to use all of the functions that are inside of this",
        "chef class",
        "so",
        "by using inheritance here",
        "I'm actually able to come over here to this anecdote pi file.",
        "and now",
        "I'm still able to execute for example like",
        "the make",
        "chicken",
        "function.",
        "even though I didn't specify the make chicken function in here I didn't write it out.",
        "I can still run this program",
        "and the chinese stuff.",
        "the chinese chef will still be able to make",
        "chicken.",
        "so when I run this program",
        "you'll see it out here it says",
        "the chef makes chicken",
        "and that's because I inherited the make chicken method",
        "from",
        "the chef class",
        "but here's one thing",
        "that",
        "got my stuff",
        "if I come over here and I say make",
        "special dish.",
        "remember the chinese chef",
        "special dish was supposed to be orange chicken.",
        "but now",
        "the chinese chef is going to be making barbecue ribs",
        "because",
        "I inherited",
        "this makes special dish",
        "function",
        "from this",
        "chef class",
        "is what I can actually do is I could come in here and I could",
        "override",
        "that",
        "make special dishcloth",
        "so I could say",
        "death",
        "make",
        "special dish.",
        "and down here",
        "I can just",
        "override it so I could say,",
        "the chef",
        "makes",
        "orange",
        "chicken",
        "and now",
        "when I go over here and I run",
        "this",
        "make special dish",
        "function.",
        "now the chefs are going to be",
        "back to making orange chicken so the chinese chef will make his",
        "special dish.",
        "so that's",
        "basically what inheritance does it allows me to inherit",
        "functionality from an existing class into the new class.",
        "and",
        "I can actually just inherit all of it without having to write it out so I didn't have to write out",
        "make",
        "chicken and make solid inside the chinese class,",
        "but",
        "the chinese chef",
        "can still make",
        "chicken and salad because it inherited that functionality from the chef class",
        "in this tutorial I wanna talk to you guys about the",
        "python interpreter.",
        "the python interpreter is basically a little environment that we can use to execute python",
        "commands.",
        "so it's kind of like this little sandbox environment where we can test out and try out different",
        "python commands are different python functions",
        "in a very safe and neutral environment.",
        "so it's kind of like a quick and dirty way to write python and try different things out.",
        "the way we use the python interpreter is by opening up",
        "opening up our command prompt.",
        "now if you're on windows there's a program called command prompt",

        "basically you need to open",
        "that program in order to use the python interpreter,",
        "so I'm here on a mac",
        "but if you're on a window as you can",
        "essentially do exactly what I'm doing just",
        "inside of the command prompt.",
        "so on mac here I'm just going to search for",
        "my terminal.",
        "if you're on windows you can just search for like cmd or command prompt in it should pop up,",
        "so the terminal is",
        "basically an environment",
        "on our computer where we can",
        "interact with the computer and do different things",
        "without a graphical user interface so normally when we interact with the computer",
        "we're using things like buttons or you know windows and you know what we can move stuff around we can",

        "interact with the computer.",
        "with graphics",
        "with the terminal or the command prompt",
        "is a place where you can interact with the computer using text commands.",

        "what the terminal the command prompt dog but that's essentially what it is.",
        "so inside of here,",
        "we can use the python interpreter",
        "and the python interpreter is basically just a little program",
        "that like I said and we can write",
        "you know sort of python",
        "in",
        "so generally,",
        "all you have to do is go over to your terminal or your command prompt",

        "python",
        "three",
