    "I had to come here - 8 months after I watched your video. I studied economics, last year of masters. Nothing to do with coding whatsoever. Then I watched this video. Now I'm 8 months to python and Django. Just got my first paid software developer job. You have completely changed the course of my life and I'm thankful for that. First time in my life I like my job. I think you can live freely because you changed someone's life, it is almost like if you gave Dobby a sock. Keep it up and thank you.",

    "Watched this video a couple years ago in high school, now I am a computer science student in my freshman year of college and in my programming fundamentals class my professor said our homework would be hard and take us 4-8 hours to complete. Obviously we are using python for this and I must say watching this video ahead of time has put me miles ahead of my classmates and I can easily finish my homework within an hour and watching a 4 hour video has taught me more than my college has taught me in a 4 month semester. Thank you!",

    "can you imagine it has taken me four days just to complete this 4 hr video, and I did an online python exam based on what you've taught and I scored a 73%. Can god bless you mike for teaching so well for free and may you live to teach more and more",
    "I am a 2nd-year computer science major and this course prepared me pretty well for the new material that we studied. Also, I landed an internship owing to this course. Kudos!",

    "Just wanted to say a huge thanks, you have taught me more than my university lecturers combined over 4+ years of just brushing over things. Very good at explaining things & really Appreciate you giving background into terms that you mention. Its also funny because we were told that Python wasn't worth looking into & yet every job I have went for is begging for people who use it. Just having knowledge into Python gives you an insane advantage with jobs",

    "Few notes, some of them for Windows users:\nYou can use \"not\" without using \"not()\" function, like \"if not is_male\".\nIn open file lesson, I had to pass a path for file even if it's in same folder, import sys then pass path like [sys.path[0] + \"\\employees.txt\"]\nIn last lesson, use \"py\" not \"python\"",
    "So, I just finished this course in about 2 full days with notes with step by step pausing each time. It is very time consuming, but compared to paying for classes/courses (which I have already done) this has to be one of the best free courses as it teaches you many basics that you can implement into more complex problems. I am very grateful to be alive in era where we can experience quality teaching with no cost. Thank you so much!!",

Some stuff I had to look up when I was trying to do string and list manipulation, like .append(), but I knew the fundamentals because of you. Thanks Mike! I hope to go further with python because I had a great idea that has potential for $$$, so thanks for setting me down this path. Hope to take programming into a career in mechatronics as well.",

Now I'm raising my grand children\nand I need to work. I have degree in math n physics. I don't know what will be the area that I should approach aerospace  . Is python used in engineering applications.  Or should I learn different language. Any advice ?",
    "So far so good! I do my best to try to incorporate the previous lessons into the following ones (for repetition) even if its redundant. for example: in the Dictionary lesson I called a user input then used if/elif to compare the variable to the month code and printed based off that. Way more work, but good practice combining things.",

    "Amazing course for beginners, thanks a lot.\nOne suggestion: if file name and class name are not the same, it would be a lot easier to understand where what has been referenced. For example, a python file name as \"Student\" for class \"student\" or file name \"Chef\" for class \"chef\", makes it slightly difficult to catch what has been referenced where in a new file. Thanks a lot once again, god bless you.",

Some even replied with a 'birthday wishes' Python program.  I have tried many times to like all the replies, but as I continue to click 'Review replies', YouTube eventually reloads.  I apologize that I cannot like every reply.  A few asked why I was learning Python at my age.  I'm still working full time, and I believe new skills are always good.  Others asked how my learning was goin.  I watch some of the video, then practice to determine how much I have learned then watch more and practice. My goal is Python certification.

    "Hello guys, i am in vacation from school, waiting to start the college, so i decided to learn programming and thats how im starting. I want to end the video in 4 days max and then start to practice! Hope u guys start doing this too.\n\r\nDay 1 of learning Python: 1:03:41 (Lists) - I wanted to start with 1h and half but thats no problem, i think it was a good beginning, im writing the new thing in an note and practicing with the pycharm. Good first day and i hope this comment help me to be more focused, cya tomorrow.\n\nDay 2 of learning Python: 2:00:37(Building a better calculator) - Second hour done, ok i finished it at 23:58 but nevermind, i did it, and i will do even better tomorrow if i get the mark i need in an exame, so, my free time depends on it. Anyway, i have the sensation that im learning the content and i still focused on finishing the video in more 2 days(this comment helped a lot btw). Hope u guys who commented are having progress too, cya tomorrow.\n\nDay 3 of learning Python:  2:00:37(Building a better calculator) - Yeah, i did nothing today xD, relaxing day.\n\nDay 4 of learning Python: 3:12:43(Reading files) - Another hour! i was not inspired to study today, but i reached the third hour and will finish this tomorrow. Im liking the course, its just a little hard to me to be focused for long periods of time, but im getting better. Python is very clean to work, compared to c#, really.\n\nDay 5 of learning Python: I did it! I learned the basics of python in 5 days, im really proud of myself for doing some productive stuff in vaction. Actually, i really liked this professor, his objective way of teaching turned it way more easy. I want to practice now and continue my coding journey. I hope this comment have been helping someone, it made me more focused because i did not want to leave the impression that i forgave and went down due to procrastination. Anyway, thanks Mike!

WHY is it we are typing code a certain way? WHY do we have to put the code in this area when it would work just as well 10 or so lines up? and you see this causes me issues because when im not being told WHY we are doing something in a certain way or why something is the way that it is my motivation shuts down because im not getting that reinforcement on what i expect which is why i would like to have friends along with this learning endeavor. i could bounce off of them and help myself by asking such little questions but over the course of asking get solid ideas and solidify my knowledge, without that i fail to retain any info. for example, i have been messing with unreal engine 4 quite alot and have done so for many years. however i couldnt tell you much about vectors, macros, struts, or what it means to initialize or serialize parts of your code. do i know the words? yes but i couldnt even begin to explain it at its most mundane. to cut this very long message short, i am going to give this video course a try, i have very little hope it will stick but im going to play it every single day for as long as i can even on days where im not at my computer to practice. my hope is that maybe by playing it regardless i will be able to memorize the words and the order things are done and maybe start to get a grip on the basics. i was told python is the most basic computer language you can learn so if i cant learn this then i cant learn any of it i would assume. wish me luck guys and i pray that this video will be my breakthrough point.",

Although,  just for future reference, it's a lot clearer when you don't use similar/same names for both a class and the name of a file. For example, I just found it very confusing in the 'building a multiple choice quiz' tutorial as you use the same name for the file name and the class. Another thing that confused me was when you would do certain things and not explain them (probably because it's so natural to you) - but to a newbie it's tough trying to figure out how one thing relates to the other in regards to the entire programme, you certainly explained things very well and made it much easier to understand, but there were a few times when you'd do something and skip over the explanation and as a Python coding beginner it feels necessary for every little thing to be explained (in my opinion).
