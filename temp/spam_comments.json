Now I'm 8 months to python and Django. Just got my first paid software developer job. You have completely changed the course of my life and I'm thankful for that. First time in my life I like my job.

I hope to go further with python because I had a great idea that has potential for $$$, so thanks for setting me down this path. Hope to take programming into a career in mechatronics as well.",

Is python used in engineering applications.  Or should I learn different language. Any advice ?",

Some even replied with a 'birthday wishes' Python program.  I have tried many times to like all the replies, but as I continue to click 'Review replies', YouTube eventually reloads.  I apologize that I cannot like every reply.  A few asked why I was learning Python at my age.  I'm still working full time, and I believe new skills are always good.  Others asked how my learning was goin.  I watch some of the video, then practice to determine how much I have learned then watch more and practice. My goal is Python certification.  Again, thank you all for your support.",

I want to end the video in 4 days max and then start to practice! Hope u guys start doing this too.\n\r\nDay 1 of learning Python: 1:03:41 (Lists) - I wanted to start with 1h and half but thats no problem, i think it was a good beginning, im writing the new thing in an note and practicing with the pycharm. Good first day and i hope this comment help me to be more focused, cya tomorrow.\n\nDay 2 of learning Python: 2:00:37(Building a better calculator) - Second hour done, ok i finished it at 23:58 but nevermind, i did it, and i will do even better tomorrow if i get the mark i need in an exame, so, my free time depends on it. Anyway, i have the sensation that im learning the content and i still focused on finishing the video in more 2 days(this comment helped a lot btw). Hope u guys who commented are having progress too, cya tomorrow.\n\nDay 3 of learning Python:  2:00:37(Building a better calculator) - Yeah, i did nothing today xD, relaxing day.\n\nDay 4 of learning Python: 3:12:43(Reading files) - Another hour! i was not inspired to study today, but i reached the third hour and will finish this tomorrow. Im liking the course, its just a little hard to me to be focused for long periods of time, but im getting better. Python is very clean to work, compared to c#, really.\n\nDay 5 of learning Python: I did it! I learned the basics of python in 5 days, im really proud of myself for doing some productive stuff in vaction. Actually, i really liked this professor, his objective way of teaching turned it way more easy. I want to practice now and continue my coding journey. I hope this comment have been helping someone, it made me more focused because i did not want to leave the impression that i forgave and went down due to procrastination. Anyway, thanks Mike!

WHY is it we are typing code a certain way? WHY do we have to put the code in this area when it would work just as well 10 or so lines up? and you see this causes me issues because when im not being told WHY we are doing something in a certain way or why something is the way that it is my motivation shuts down because im not getting that reinforcement on what i expect which is why i would like to have friends along with this learning endeavor. i could bounce off of them and help myself by asking such little questions but over the course of asking get solid ideas and solidify my knowledge, without that i fail to retain any info. for example, i have been messing with unreal engine 4 quite alot and have done so for many years. however i couldnt tell you much about vectors, macros, struts, or what it means to initialize or serialize parts of your code. do i know the words? yes but i couldnt even begin to explain it at its most mundane. to cut this very long message short, i am going to give this video course a try, i have very little hope it will stick but im going to play it every single day for as long as i can even on days where im not at my computer to practice. my hope is that maybe by playing it regardless i will be able to memorize the words and the order things are done and maybe start to get a grip on the basics. i was told python is the most basic computer language you can learn so if i cant learn this then i cant learn any of it i would assume. wish me luck guys and i pray that this video will be my breakthrough point.",

What can Python do outside of work, for the layman who's never used coding software in their life like me?

That also leaves me stumped on one other point. When people say they spent a few hours of their evening for a \"coding session\", or having YouTube recommend me \"lo-fi playlists for coding\", what are you all even doing? Are you coding individual projects for freelance? Are you working from home at a corporate job? What projects are you even working on?\n\nPython, and coding languages in and of themselves are so convoluted that I can't really get a clear picture on what they're used for.",

Instead, a new page would open, and take me to the Window's app store to install Python, even though I already had it on my computer. I clicked install, and now python shows up in the terminal. My first question is, what did I do wrong there? Why wasn't python showing up in the terminal when I had initially downloaded it from the website?  My second question has to deal with getting files from text editors to appear on the terminal. When I saved a file on Pycharm, and I opened the terminal and typed in \"python 'file name'.py\" it showed an error message. When I tried to troubleshoot the issue, I believe it has something to do with the pathway of these files, but I am still very confused on how to fix this. If anyone can help me, I'd greatly appreciate it. (I have a Windows 10)",
