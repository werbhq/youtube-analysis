    "I had to come here - 8 months after I watched your video. I studied economics, last year of masters. Nothing to do with coding whatsoever. Then I watched this video. Now I'm 8 months to python and Django. Just got my first paid software developer job. You have completely changed the course of my life and I'm thankful for that. First time in my life I like my job. I think you can live freely because you changed someone's life, it is almost like if you gave Dobby a sock. Keep it up and thank you.",

    "Watched this video a couple years ago in high school, now I am a computer science student in my freshman year of college and in my programming fundamentals class my professor said our homework would be hard and take us 4-8 hours to complete. Obviously we are using python for this and I must say watching this video ahead of time has put me miles ahead of my classmates and I can easily finish my homework within an hour and watching a 4 hour video has taught me more than my college has taught me in a 4 month semester. Thank you!",

    "can you imagine it has taken me four days just to complete this 4 hr video, and I did an online python exam based on what you've taught and I scored a 73%. Can god bless you mike for teaching so well for free and may you live to teach more and more",
    "Few notes, some of them for Windows users:\nYou can use \"not\" without using \"not()\" function, like \"if not is_male\".\nIn open file lesson, I had to pass a path for file even if it's in same folder, import sys then pass path like [sys.path[0] + \"\\employees.txt\"]\nIn last lesson, use \"py\" not \"python\"",
    "So, I just finished this course in about 2 full days with notes with step by step pausing each time. It is very time consuming, but compared to paying for classes/courses (which I have already done) this has to be one of the best free courses as it teaches you many basics that you can implement into more complex problems. I am very grateful to be alive in era where we can experience quality teaching with no cost. Thank you so much!!",
    "Halfway through and all I can say is this is amazing man! Really good quality and easy to follow, been taking several notes, it serves as a good video to learn or as in my case to remember basic Python coding!",
    "When I got to the translator, I made a pig-Latin translator program that converts English to pig-Latin using everything I learned so far. Dictionaries, functions and for and while loops. Some stuff I had to look up when I was trying to do string and list manipulation, like .append(), but I knew the fundamentals because of you. Thanks Mike! I hope to go further with python because I had a great idea that has potential for $$$, so thanks for setting me down this path. Hope to take programming into a career in mechatronics as well.",

I do my best to try to incorporate the previous lessons into the following ones (for repetition) even if its redundant. for example: in the Dictionary lesson I called a user input then used if/elif to compare the variable to the month code and printed based off that. Way more work, but good practice combining things.",

    "Amazing course for beginners, thanks a lot.\nOne suggestion: if file name and class name are not the same, it would be a lot easier to understand where what has been referenced. For example, a python file name as \"Student\" for class \"student\" or file name \"Chef\" for class \"chef\", makes it slightly difficult to catch what has been referenced where in a new file.

Some even replied with a 'birthday wishes' Python program.  I have tried many times to like all the replies, but as I continue to click 'Review replies', YouTube eventually reloads.  I apologize that I cannot like every reply.  A few asked why I was learning Python at my age.  I'm still working full time, and I believe new skills are always good.  Others asked how my learning was goin.  I watch some of the video, then practice to determine how much I have learned then watch more and practice. My goal is Python certification.  Again, thank you all for your support.",

I want to end the video in 4 days max and then start to practice! Hope u guys start doing this too.\n\r\nDay 1 of learning Python: 1:03:41 (Lists) - I wanted to start with 1h and half but thats no problem, i think it was a good beginning, im writing the new thing in an note and practicing with the pycharm. Good first day and i hope this comment help me to be more focused, cya tomorrow.\n\nDay 2 of learning Python: 2:00:37(Building a better calculator) - Second hour done, ok i finished it at 23:58 but nevermind, i did it, and i will do even better tomorrow if i get the mark i need in an exame, so, my free time depends on it. Anyway, i have the sensation that im learning the content and i still focused on finishing the video in more 2 days(this comment helped a lot btw). Hope u guys who commented are having progress too, cya tomorrow.\n\nDay 3 of learning Python:  2:00:37(Building a better calculator) - Yeah, i did nothing today xD, relaxing day.\n\nDay 4 of learning Python: 3:12:43(Reading files) - Another hour! i was not inspired to study today, but i reached the third hour and will finish this tomorrow. Im liking the course, its just a little hard to me to be focused for long periods of time, but im getting better. Python is very clean to work, compared to c#, really.\n\nDay 5 of learning Python: I did it! I learned the basics of python in 5 days, im really proud of myself for doing some productive stuff in vaction. Actually, i really liked this professor, his objective way of teaching turned it way more easy. I want to practice now and continue my coding journey. I hope this comment have been helping someone, it made me more focused because i did not want to leave the impression that i forgave and went down due to procrastination. Anyway, thanks Mike!

FORTRAN, versions of BASIC and bits of Pascal, PL/1, and even the old, old 8080 assembly. Those may be old but having that background makes it a lot easier to pick up the more modern languages. (Not that questions don\u2019t still come up during the studying.) I didn\u2019t have to program for years because most software I needed could be purchased (database, search apps, and other utilities). But recently I need a program to do a task such that I will have to code it myself. So Python seems like a good candidate. This course is remarkable in its clear presentation and scope. My recently acquired Python version, however, is now 3.10 and the screens have become laden with many uncovered menus and options. I congratulate Mike on his very clear speaking ability, his knowledge of idioms (for one apparently so young), his exceptional talent for teaching, and thorough knowledge of the material.

    "i am going to give this course a try. i am very new to programming in terms of experience, granted i have been playing around in unity, unreal 4, and others for a long LONG time now but i have never been able to get going because i lack the focus and the ability to sit with it all the way through. problem one being i have no one to learn with and thus i feel as if my goal to learn is pointless? whats the point in me learning if i have no friends that i can learn with or talk to during the process? i have no one that shares the interest in my life so why must i dedicate all of my time learning what is essentially a waste of my time? i am well aware that i am wrong, i am well aware that this train of thought is common and is a reason why many people struggle and or fail to ever catch on and i have heard all of the same encouraging themes before such as \"dont let their absence stop you from learning something new\" or \"you can do it and excel if you just put in the time\"... my other problems are that my brain likes to know WHY alot. WHY is it we are typing code a certain way? WHY do we have to put the code in this area when it would work just as well 10 or so lines up? and you see this causes me issues because when im not being told WHY we are doing something in a certain way or why something is the way that it is my motivation shuts down because im not getting that reinforcement on what i expect which is why i would like to have friends along with this learning endeavor. i could bounce off of them and help myself by asking such little questions but over the course of asking get solid ideas and solidify my knowledge, without that i fail to retain any info. for example, i have been messing with unreal engine 4 quite alot and have done so for many years. however i couldnt tell you much about vectors, macros, struts, or what it means to initialize or serialize parts of your code. do i know the words? yes but i couldnt even begin to explain it at its most mundane. to cut this very long message short, i am going to give this video course a try, i have very little hope it will stick but im going to play it every single day for as long as i can even on days where im not at my computer to practice. my hope is that maybe by playing it regardless i will be able to memorize the words and the order things are done and maybe start to get a grip on the basics. i was told python is the most basic computer language you can learn so if i cant learn this then i cant learn any of it i would assume. wish me luck guys and i pray that this video will be my breakthrough point.",

    "Great work man, I never understood the concept of coding like how i get it now before this video .I am a B.tech(Engineering) graduate and wish if I had a teacher like u in my graduation days I would have done 10 times better in my programing class and project works .Thank you once again",
    "Quick note: On Windows 10 on the command prompt you can write \"python\" to get the python interpreter (currently on Python 3.10.5). Great course man! Thanks a lot! Keep up the good work!",
    "I've learned other programmings languages for a living and this is, by far, the only tutorial that will bring you from literal zero to hero!\n\nYou also show and clearly explain a lot of great practices such as separating your class files and inheritance in python.\n\nKeep up the great work!",
    "You are a legend mike.Never saw anyone teaching and explaining so precisely.Guys just watch this video and practice for like a month to become great at python.Thanks buddy",
    "I'm 2:41:20 into this course, have done ever single tutorial within pycharm, and I won't give up\n\nUpdate: I completed it! I will continue to update my coding journey!\n\nUpdate 10/02/22: I\u2019ve taken what I\u2019ve learned in this video and made my first project; a program that will help me in my job! It\u2019s essentially a multiple choice questionnaire that determines where to transfer a caller based on their responses. Every single question affects where the transferee will end up; it uses a ton of \u2018if statements\u2019! I tried to use what I learned with classes, but I couldn\u2019t really figure it out. However, this program works great and if a great first project, I think!\n\nUpdate 10/04/22: I've gone over to freecodecamp and started their course! I started with the top of the list and have made a catphotoapp and a coffee menu. I will keep updating as I go through this course",

    "Mike, you have a gift of explaining Python programming in an \"easy to understand\" and \"easy to follow\" approach. I so appreciate your video tutorial. I can easily understand python concepts you cover in this tutorial and apply them in my practice. Thanks so much!!!!",
    "Thank you for this video! After watching this as a total beginner, I challenged myself to code a score-tracker for one of my favourite card games. It took 2 days of trial and error, but I finally managed to code it!",
    "This course is whole lot awesome. I always wanted to learn a programming language, and Mike made it easy for me. Finished learning 4 and half hours python basics. Now, I need to step to next levels. Thank you Mike",
    "You are a really good teacher. You have a gift to simplify concepts, explain clearly and show them in a way that facilitates natural learning. \nI also really enjoyed your simple yet effective examples, they are excellent for learning (and very bespoke to you). \nIt would probably be great if there is part-2 of this video or series to continue the learning journey. \nThanks again for the awesome course... .much appreciated. Keep up the good work.",
    "Just wrapped this up. Followed right along, fixed all my errors and I feel like I'm ready to try a simple project. I'm also pumped to keep learning. Thanks!",
    "This has been an amazing course to really get started in understanding the language where I can progress with more specific areas. Very easy to follow along and understand! Thank you!",
    "I just finished the whole thing - great video, it helped a lot! Although,  just for future reference, it's a lot clearer when you don't use similar/same names for both a class and the name of a file. For example, I just found it very confusing in the 'building a multiple choice quiz' tutorial as you use the same name for the file name and the class. Another thing that confused me was when you would do certain things and not explain them (probably because it's so natural to you) - but to a newbie it's tough trying to figure out how one thing relates to the other in regards to the entire programme, you certainly explained things very well and made it much easier to understand, but there were a few times when you'd do something and skip over the explanation and as a Python coding beginner it feels necessary for every little thing to be explained (in my opinion). But other than those 2 minor things this was extremely helpful so thanks a lot for the video and the effort that you put into making it, we really appreciate it man! :)",
    "I absolutely love this so far. Only 15mins in and I've grasped the basics. Love how you literally explain *everything* step by step, so that absolutely *anyone* regardless of their career field or skill set can understand.\nI'm hoping to learn coding and if I enjoy it, then step into a new career in programming, doing something fulfilling not only for myself but also helping wider society. (I feel a bit like Aloy from the Horizon games fiddling around with machines! \ud83d\ude06)\nThank you so much for sharing this \ud83d\udc99. Cannot wait to see all the other vids.\n*Goes back to watching*",
    "Can't express enough how much I appreciate people like you for making these free, well done tutorials. Really got me started man",
    "It took me ages to do the easy (variables and data types) tutorial just because it did not concatenate. I had to put an str in front of the age variable. I didn't know that because you did not explain it and beccause it worked for you i assumed it would for me but it didn't. maybe its because i have a newer python.10 or something. omg i am so pissed.",

    "I\u2019m a college freshman (junior in credits) and this semester I enrolled in the intro to computer science course. I\u2019ve always been good in math and science and have been interested in technology but never really got around to figuring out hardware or software. In my college intro to programming source I found that I really enjoyed the basics I\u2019ve learned in just one week. I ended up doing a bunch of stuff and got 3 weeks ahead in the course. I just found this video and now I see that it teaches almost everything that is mentioned in the syllabus for the class in just 4.5 hours. I haven\u2019t watched all of it yet, but 45 minutes in and I\u2019ve already seen everything I\u2019ve already figured out to get 3 weeks ahead in my class.
